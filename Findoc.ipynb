Citi does business in nearly 160 countries and jurisdictions.\\n\\nCiti’s vision is to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in the U.S.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, Citi had approximately 239,000 full-time employees, largely unchanged from December 31, 2022. For additional information, see “Human Capital Resources and Management” below.\\n\\nThroughout this report, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and “the Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. For a list of certain terms and acronyms used herein, see “Glossary of Terms and Acronyms” at the end of this report. All “Note” references correspond to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\n\\nAdditional information about Citigroup is available on Citi’s website at www.citigroup.com. Citigroup’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as well as other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge through Citi’s website by clicking on “SEC Filings” under the “Investors” tab. The SEC’s website also contains these filings and other information regarding Citi at www.sec.gov.\\n\\n### Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nCiti prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Citi believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results for investors, industry analysts and others, including increased transparency and clarity into Citi’s results, and improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows Citi to provide a long-term strategic view of its businesses and results going forward. These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other companies.\\n---\\n## New Financial Reporting Structure\\n\\n|CITIGROUP REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS|\\n|---|\\n|Services|Markets|Banking|U.S. Personal Banking|Wealth|\\n|Treasury and Trade Solutions|Fixed Income|Investment Banking|Branded Cards|Private Bank|\\n|Securities Services|Equities|Corporate Lending|Retail Services|Wealth at Work|\\n|Legacy Franchises|All Other| |Corporate/Other| |\\n|Mexico Consumer, Small Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico Consumer/SBMM)| | | | |\\n|Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer)| | | | |\\n|Legacy Holdings Assets| | | | |\\n\\nREGIONS\\n\\nNorth America\\n\\nInternational\\n\\nNote: Mexico is included in International.\\n---\\n## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n\\nAs described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi demonstrated substantial progress across the franchise during 2023, despite the impact of several notable items in the fourth quarter:\\n\\n- Citi’s revenues increased 4% versus the prior year, reflecting an increase in net interest income in Services and U.S. Personal Banking (USPB), driven by higher interest rates, as well as loan growth in cards. The increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-interest revenues, primarily driven by approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate translation losses (including approximately $880 million in the fourth quarter) due to devaluations of the Argentine peso during the year, the impact of lower volatility in Markets and the contraction of the global investment banking wallet in Investment Banking.\\n- Citi’s expenses increased 10% versus the prior year. The increase included fourth-quarter pretax charges of approximately $1.7 billion associated with the FDIC special assessment and approximately $780 million of restructuring charges. Excluding both of these charges, expenses increased 5%, driven by increased investments in other risk and controls and technology, elevated business-as-usual severance costs and additional transformation and business-led investments. The increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see “Expenses” below).\\n- Citi’s cost of credit was $9.2 billion versus $5.2 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services, reflecting normalization from historically low levels. The increase was also due to net builds in the allowance for credit losses (ACL), including approximately $1.9 billion in builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina (including approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as well as builds due to volume growth in Branded Cards and Retail Services.\\n- Citi returned $6.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends ($4.1 billion) and share repurchases ($2.0 billion).\\n- Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of December 31, 2022 (see “Capital Resources” below). This compares to Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of October 1, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized Approach.\\n- Citi closed the four remaining signed consumer banking sale transactions in 2023. Citi also continued to make progress with the wind-downs of the Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses, as well as the planned initial public offering of Citi’s consumer banking operations in Mexico, and restarted the sales process for its Poland consumer banking business.\\n\\n2023 Results Summary\\n\\nCitigroup\\nCitigroup reported net income of $9.2 billion, or $4.04 per share, compared to net income of $14.8 billion, or $7.00 per share in pe prior year. Net income decreased 38% versus pe prior year, driven by pe higher expenses, pe higher cost of credit and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by pe higher revenues. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 27% in 2023 versus 19% in pe prior year, largely driven by pe geographic mix of earnings (see Note 10).\\n\\nAs discussed above, results for 2023 included several notable items impacting pretax revenues, expenses and cost of credit:\\n\\n- Approximately $1.9 billion of aggregate translation losses in revenues due to devaluations of the Argentine peso\\n- Approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate reserve builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law\\n- An approximate $1.7 billion charge to operating expenses related to the FDIC special assessment in the fourth quarter\\n- Approximately $780 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, recorded in operating expenses in Corporate/Other within All Other (managed basis), related to actions taken as part of Citi’s organizational simplification initiatives\\n\\nIn total, on an after-tax basis the notable items were $(5.4) billion.\\n\\nAdditionally, results for 2023 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $1.0 billion (approximately $659 million after-tax), primarily driven by gains on sale of Citi’s India and Taiwan consumer banking businesses. (See “All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.)\\n\\nThe above notable items and divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $2.40 negative impact on EPS in 2023. For additional information on the translation losses due to the devaluations of the Argentine peso, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” below and “Services,” “Markets” and “Banking” below. Excluding the notable items and divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $6.44. (As used throughout this Form 10-K, Citi’s results of operations and financial condition excluding the notable items and divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)\\n\\nResults for 2022 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of $82 million. (See “All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.) Collectively, divestiture-related impacts had a $0.09 negative impact on EPS.\\n---\\n## EPS\\n\\nExcluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS in 2022 was $7.09. Results in 2022 also included approximately $820 million of translation losses in revenues due to the devaluations of the Argentine peso.\\n\\n## Citigroup Revenues\\n\\n| |2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Reported Basis|$78.5 billion|4% increase|\\n|Excluding Divestiture-Related Impacts|$77.1 billion|4% increase|\\n|Excluding Divestiture-Related and Argentine Peso Devaluation Impacts|$79 billion|5% increase|\\n\\n## Net Credit Losses\\n\\nNet credit losses of $6.4 billion increased 70% from the prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $6.2 billion increased 71%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit loss rates from historically low levels. Corporate net credit losses increased to $250 million from $178 million.\\n\\n## Capital\\n\\nCitigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of December 31, 2022, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA).\\n\\n## Expenses\\n\\nCitigroup’s operating expenses of $56.4 billion increased 10% from the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi incurred the approximate $1.7 billion charge associated with the FDIC special assessment and approximately $780 million of restructuring charges related to Citi’s organizational simplification initiatives.\\n\\n## Services\\n\\nServices net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, as higher expenses and higher cost of credit were partially offset by the increase in revenues. Services expenses of $10.0 billion increased 15%, primarily driven by continued investment in technology and other risk and controls.\\n\\n## Cost of Credit\\n\\nCiti’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $9.2 billion, compared to $5.2 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services, reflecting the normalization to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023.\\n---\\n## Services\\n\\nServices revenues of $18.1 billion increased 16%, driven operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-led by net interest income growth of 28%, partially offset by an 8% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluations (approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and approximately $0.4 billion in 2022). Excluding this impact, non-interest revenue increased 6%.\\n\\nTTS revenues of $13.6 billion increased 16%, driven by 25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluations. The increase in TTS net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds management across currencies, as well as growth in deposits. Excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-interest revenue increased 10%, driven by continued growth in underlying drivers.\\n\\nSecurities Services revenues of $4.4 billion increased 15%, as net interest income grew 46%, partially offset by a 5% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluations. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by lower average deposits. Excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-interest revenue increased 1%, driven by increased fees from higher AUC/AUA balances from new client business and deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.\\n\\nFor additional information on the results of operations of Services in 2023, see “Services” below.\\n\\n## Markets\\n\\nMarkets net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Markets expenses of $13.2 billion increased 7%, primarily driven by investments in transformation, technology and other risk and controls, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit increased to $437 million from $155 million in the prior year, driven by an ACL build in other assets, largely due to the reserve build for increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina.\\n\\nMarkets revenues of $18.9 billion decreased 6%, driven by a 6% decrease in Fixed Income markets and a 9% decrease in Equity markets. The decrease in Fixed Income was driven by a decrease in rates and currencies and spread products reflecting lower volatility, the impact of the Argentine peso devaluations, a strong prior-year comparison and a significant slowdown in activity in December 2023. The decrease in Equity markets was primarily due to a decline in equity derivatives, due to lower institutional activity, spread compression and lower volatility.\\n\\nFor additional information on the results of operations of Markets in 2023, see “Markets” below.\\n\\n## Banking\\n\\nBanking reported a net loss of $48 million, compared to net income of $386 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower Corporate Lending revenues, including the impact of a loss on loan hedges, and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. Banking expenses of $4.9 billion increased 9%, primarily driven by the absence of an\\n\\nFor additional information on the results of operations of Banking in 2023, see “Banking” below.\\n\\n## U.S. Personal Banking\\n\\nUSPB net income of $1.8 billion decreased 34%, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. USPB expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, business-led investments and business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit increased to $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior year. The increase was largely driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net ACL build, primarily reflecting growth in loan balances in Branded Cards and Retail Services.\\n\\nUSPB revenues of $19.2 billion increased 14%, due to higher net interest income (up 12%), driven by strong loan growth and higher deposit spreads, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 19%). Branded Cards revenues of $10.0 billion increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as average loans increased 13%. Retail Services revenues of $6.6 billion increased 21%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income from loan growth, as well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by higher net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues of $2.6 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth.\\n---\\n## For additional information on the results of operations of respective business’s results of operations and “Managing USPB in 2023, see “U.S. Personal Banking” below.\\n\\nGlobal Risk,” including “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks —Country Risk—Russia” and “—Argentina” below.\\n\\n## Wealth\\n\\nWealth net income of $346 million decreased 64%, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. Wealth expenses increased 10% to $6.6 billion, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and re-pacing of strategic investments. Cost of credit was a net benefit of $2 million, compared to cost of credit of $306 million in the prior year, largely driven by a net ACL release.\\n\\nWealth revenues of $7.1 billion decreased 5%, largely driven by lower net interest income (down 6%), driven by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower non-interest revenue (down 3%), largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from USPB.\\n\\nFor additional information on the results of operations of Wealth in 2023, see “Wealth” below.\\n\\n## CITI\\'S CONSENT ORDER COMPLIANCE\\n\\nCiti has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to change Citi’s business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and improve Citi’s value to customers, clients and shareholders.\\n\\nThis includes efforts to effectively implement the October 2020 Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) consent orders issued to Citigroup and Citibank, respectively. In the second quarter of 2021, Citi made an initial submission to the OCC, and submitted its plans to address the consent orders to both regulators during the third quarter of 2021. Citi continues to work constructively with the regulators and provides to both regulators on an ongoing basis additional information regarding its plans and progress. Citi will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts.\\n\\nAs discussed above, Citi’s efforts include continued investments in its transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders. Citi’s CEO has made the strengthening of Citi’s risk and control environment a strategic priority and has established a Chief Operating Officer organization to centralize program management. In addition, the Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each formed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of each Board, to provide oversight of management’s remediation efforts under the consent orders. The Citi Board of Directors has determined that Citi’s plans are responsive to the Company’s objectives and that progress continues to be made on execution of the plans.\\n\\nFor additional information about the consent orders, see “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” below and Citi’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2020.\\n\\n## All Other (Managed Basis)\\n\\nAll Other (managed basis) net loss of $2.1 billion, compared to net income of $163 million in the prior year, was driven by higher expenses, primarily due to the $1.7 billion FDIC special assessment, and higher cost of credit due to ACL builds for loans in Mexico Consumer and other assets, reflecting an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia. The higher expenses and cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year release of cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) losses (net of hedges) from AOCI, recorded in revenues (approximately $140 million pretax), and in discontinued operations (approximately $260 million pretax), related to the substantial liquidation of a U.K. consumer legacy operation (see Note 2).\\n\\nFor additional information on the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) in 2023, see “All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” and “All Other (Managed Basis)” below.\\n\\n## Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties\\n\\nVarious geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely affect economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, continued elevated interest rates, elevated inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to China, the Russia–Ukraine war and escalating conflicts in the Middle East. These and other factors have negatively impacted global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and have resulted in a continued risk of recession in various regions and countries globally. In addition, these and other factors could adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during 2024.\\n\\nFor a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during 2024, see “Executive Summary” above and “Risk Factors,” each\\n---\\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\n## SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Net interest income|$54,900|$48,668|$42,494|$44,751|$48,128|\\n|Non-interest revenue|23,562|26,670|29,390|30,750|26,939|\\n|Revenues, net of interest expense|$78,462|$75,338|$71,884|$75,501|$75,067|\\n|Operating expenses|56,366|51,292|48,193|44,374|42,783|\\n|Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims|9,186|5,239|(3,778)|17,495|8,383|\\n|Income from continuing operations before income taxes|$12,910|$18,807|$27,469|$13,632|$23,901|\\n|Income taxes|3,528|3,642|5,451|2,525|4,430|\\n|Income from continuing operations|$9,382|$15,165|$22,018|$11,107|$19,471|\\n|Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes|(1)|(231)|7|(20)|(4)|\\n|Net income before attribution of noncontrolling interests|$9,381|$14,934|$22,025|$11,087|$19,467|\\n|Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests|153|89|73|40|66|\\n|Citigroup’s net income|$9,228|$14,845|$21,952|$11,047|$19,401|\\n\\n|Earnings per share|\\n|---|\\n|Basic|\\n|Income from continuing operations|$4.07|$7.16|$10.21|$4.75|$8.08|\\n|Net income|4.07|7.04|10.21|4.74|8.08|\\n|Diluted|\\n|Income from continuing operations|$4.04|$7.11|$10.14|$4.73|$8.04|\\n|Net income|4.04|7.00|10.14|4.72|8.04|\\n|Dividends declared per common share|2.08|2.04|2.04|2.04|1.92|\\n\\n|Common dividends|$4,076|$4,028|$4,196|$4,299|$4,403|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Preferred dividends|1,198|1,032|1,040|1,095|1,109|\\n|Common share repurchases|2,000|3,250|7,600|2,925|17,875|\\n---\\n## SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\\n\\n## (Continued) Citigroup Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|At December 31:| | | | | |\\n|Total assets|$ 2,411,834|$ 2,416,676|$ 2,291,413|$ 2,260,090|$ 1,951,158|\\n|Total deposits|1,308,681|1,365,954|1,317,230|1,280,671|1,070,590|\\n|Long-term debt|286,619|271,606|254,374|271,686|248,760|\\n|Citigroup common stockholders’ equity|187,853|182,194|182,977|179,962|175,262|\\n|Total Citigroup stockholders’ equity|205,453|201,189|201,972|199,442|193,242|\\n|Average assets|2,442,233|2,396,023|2,347,709|2,226,454|1,978,805|\\n|Direct staff (in thousands)|239|240|223|210|210|\\n\\n|Performance metrics| | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Return on average assets|0.38 %|0.62 %|0.94 %|0.50 %|0.98 %|\\n|Return on average common stockholders’ equity (1)|4.3|7.7|11.5|5.7|10.3|\\n|Return on average total stockholders’ equity (1)|4.5|7.5|10.9|5.7|9.9|\\n|Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) (2)|4.9|8.9|13.4|6.6|12.1|\\n|Efficiency ratio (total operating expenses/total revenues, net)|71.8|68.1|67.0|58.8|57.0|\\n\\n|Basel III ratios| | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|CET1 Capital (3)|13.37 %|13.03 %|12.25 %|11.51 %|11.79 %|\\n|Tier 1 Capital (3)|15.02|14.80|13.91|13.06|13.33|\\n|Total Capital (3)|15.13|15.46|16.04|15.33|15.87|\\n|Supplementary Leverage ratio|5.82|5.82|5.73|6.99|6.20|\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Citigroup common stockholders’ equity to assets|7.79 %|7.54 %|7.99 %|7.96 %|8.98 %|\\n|Total Citigroup stockholders’ equity to assets|8.52|8.33|8.81|8.82|9.90|\\n|Dividend payout ratio (4)|51|29|20|43|24|\\n|Total payout ratio (5)|76|53|56|73|122|\\n|Book value per common share|$ 98.71|$ 94.06|$ 92.21|$ 86.43|$ 82.90|\\n|Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) (2)|86.19|81.65|79.16|73.67|70.39|\\n\\n(1) The return on average common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ equity.

TTS provides an integrated suite of tailored cash management, trade and working capital solutions to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations. Securities Services provides cross-border support for clients, providing on-the-ground local market expertise, post-trade technologies, customized data solutions and a wide range of securities services solutions that can be tailored to meet clients’ needs.\\n\\nServices revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. Services earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration and is recognized when the associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the client and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5. Services revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, Services had $585 billion in assets and $779 billion in deposits. Securities Services managed $25.1 trillion in assets under custody and administration, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to $1.8 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.1 trillion.\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|% Change 2023 vs. 2022|% Change 2022 vs. 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Net interest income (including dividends)|$13,198|$10,318|$6,821|28%|51%|\\n|Fee revenue| | | | | |\\n|Commissions and fees|$3,118|$2,882|$2,550|8%|13%|\\n|Other|$2,508|$2,490|$2,447|1%|2%|\\n|Total fee revenue|$5,626|$5,372|$4,997|5%|8%|\\n|Principal transactions|$1,006|$854|$782|18%|9%|\\n|All other (1)|($1,780)|($925)|($77)|(92%)|NM|\\n|Total non-interest revenue|$4,852|$5,301|$5,702|(8%)|(7%)|\\n|Total revenues, net of interest expense|$18,050|$15,619|$12,523|16%|25%|\\n|Total operating expenses|$10,024|$8,728|$7,706|15%|13%|\\n|Net credit losses on loans|$40|$51|$42|(22%)|21%|\\n|Credit reserve build (release) for loans|$47|$128|($248)|(63%)|NM|\\n|Provision (release) for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments|($18)|$24|($61)|NM|NM|\\n|Provisions for credit losses for other assets and HTM debt securities|$881|$4|$4|NM|—|\\n|Provision (release) for credit losses|$950|$207|($263)|NM|NM|\\n|Income from continuing operations before taxes|$7,076|$6,684|$5,080|6%|32%|\\n|Income taxes|$2,405|$1,760|$1,312|37%|34%|\\n|Income from continuing operations|$4,671|$4,924|$3,768|(5%)|31%|\\n|Noncontrolling interests|$66|$36|$6|83%|NM|\\n|Net income|$4,605|$4,888|$3,762|(6%)|30%|\\n\\nBalance Sheet data (in billions of dollars)\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|% Change 2023 vs. 2022|% Change 2022 vs. 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|EOP assets|$585|$599|$547|(2%)|10%|\\n|Average assets|$582|$545|$556|7|(2)|\\n\\nEfficiency ratio: 56%, 56%, 62%\\n\\nRevenue by component\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|% Change 2023 vs. 2022|% Change 2022 vs. 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Net interest income|$11,027|$8,832|$5,913|25%|49%|\\n|Non-interest revenue|$2,625|$2,947|$3,247|(11%)|(9%)|\\n|Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS)|$13,652|$11,779|$9,160|16%|29%|\\n|Securities Services|$4,398|$3,840|$3,363|15%|14%|\\n|Total Services|$18,050|$15,619|$12,523|16%|25%|\\n---\\n## Revenue by geography\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023 vs. 2022|2022 vs. 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|North America|$5,132|$4,782|$3,748|7%|28%|\\n|International|12,918|10,837|8,775|19|23|\\n|Total|$18,050|$15,619|$12,523|16%|25%|\\n\\n## Key drivers (2)\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023 vs. 2022|2022 vs. 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Average loans by reporting unit (in billions of dollars)| | | | | |\\n|TTS|$80|$80|$72|—%|11%|\\n|Securities Services|1|2|2|(50)|—|\\n|Total|$81|$82|$74|(1)%|11%|\\n|ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans (3)|0.47%|0.46%|0.24%| | |\\n|Average deposits by reporting unit and selected component (in billions of dollars)| | | | | |\\n|TTS|$687|$675|$670|2%|1%|\\n|Securities Services|123|133|135|(8)|(1)|\\n|Total|$810|$808|$805|—%|—%|\\n\\n(1) Includes revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.\\n\\n(2) Management uses this information in reviewing the segment’s results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.\\n\\n(3) Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.\\n\\nNM Not meaningful\\n\\n## 2023 vs. 2022\\n\\nExpenses were up 15%, primarily driven by continued Net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, primarily driven by higher expenses and higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues.\\n\\nRevenues increased 16%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities Services, largely driven by net interest income growth, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue due to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluations.\\n\\nTTS revenues increased 16%, reflecting 25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds management across currencies as well as growth in deposits.\\n\\nAverage deposits increased 2%, largely driven by growth in international markets. The decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by approximately $1.0 billion in translation losses in revenues in Argentina due to devaluations of the Argentine peso, including a $0.5 billion translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding these translation losses, non-interest revenue grew 10%, reflecting continued growth in underlying drivers, including higher cross-border flows (up 15%), U.S. dollar clearing volumes (up 6%) and commercial card spend (up 16%).\\n\\nSecurities Services revenues increased 15%, as net interest income grew 46%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits and lower non-interest revenue.\\n\\n## 2022 vs. 2021\\n\\nNet income of $4.9 billion increased 30%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.\\n\\nServices revenues were up 25%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities Services.\\n\\nTTS revenues increased 29%, largely due to 49% growth in net interest income, reflecting deepening of existing client relations and gaining new clients across segments. The increase in net interest income was also driven by the benefits from higher interest rates, balance sheet optimization, higher\\n---\\naverage deposits and higher average loans. Average deposits grew 1%, as volume growth was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average loans grew 11%, primarily driven by the strength in trade flows in International, partially offset by loan sales in North America.\\n\\nSecurities Services revenues increased 14%, primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates across currencies as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. Non-interest revenues decreased 4%, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower fees in the custody business due to lower AUC/AUA (decline of 6%), driven by declines in global financial markets. The decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services and new client onboarding of $1.2 trillion in AUC/AUA. Average deposits declined 1%, due to clients seeking higher rate alternatives.\\n\\nExpenses were up 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in Citi’s technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in TTS.\\n\\nProvisions were $207 million, compared to a benefit of $263 million in the prior year, driven by an ACL build on loans and unfunded lending commitments.\\n\\nThe ACL build was $156 million, compared to a release of $305 million in the prior year. The ACL build was primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.\\n---\\n## MARKETS\\n\\nMarkets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.\\n\\nAs a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest income.\\n\\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.\\n\\nAssuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory.

The higher expenses and cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year release of CTA losses (net of hedges) from AOCI, consisting of approximately $140 million recorded in revenues and approximately $260 million pretax recorded in discontinued operations, related to the substantial liquidation of a U.K. consumer legacy operation (see Note 2).\\n\\nAll Other (managed basis) revenues\\nIncreased 4%\\nDriven by higher revenues in Corporate/Other, partially offset by lower revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis).\\n\\nLegacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues\\nDecreased 4%\\nPrimarily driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis), partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).\\n\\nMexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues\\nIncreased 23%\\nAs cards revenues in Mexico Consumer increased 31%, SBMM revenues increased 28% and retail banking revenues increased 19%, mainly due to the benefit of FX translation as well as higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth.\\n\\nAsia Consumer (managed basis) revenues\\nDecreased 48%\\nPrimarily driven by the reduction from exited markets and wind-downs.\\n\\nCorporate/Other revenues were $2.2 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income. The higher net interest income was primarily due to higher interest rates on deposits with banks and the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher cost of funds.\\n\\nExpenses increased 22%, primarily driven by the $1.7 billion FDIC special assessment related to regional bank failures, restructuring charges and higher business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by lower consulting expenses and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets. The restructuring charges were recorded in the fourth quarter and primarily consisted of severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to the organizational simplification initiatives (see Note 9).\\n\\nProvisions were $1.3 billion, compared to $498 million in the prior year, driven by a higher net ACL build for loans and other assets and higher net credit losses. Net credit losses increased 13%, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.\\n\\nThe net ACL build for loans was $106 million, compared to a net release of $368 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer. The net ACL build in other assets was primarily due to the reserve build for transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.\\n\\nFor additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to All Other’s (managed basis) future results, see “Executive Summary” above and “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.\\n\\n## 2022 vs. 2021\\n\\nNet income was $163 million, compared to net income of $1.0 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher cost of credit and the release of the CTA losses (net of hedges) from AOCI.\\n\\nAll Other (managed basis) revenues\\nDecreased 5%\\nDriven by lower revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis), and lower non-interest revenue in Corporate/Other, partially offset by higher net interest income in Corporate/Other.\\n\\nLegacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues\\nDecreased 14%\\nPrimarily driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).\\n\\nMexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues\\nIncreased 2%\\nAs cards revenues in Mexico Consumer increased 6% and SBMM revenues increased 10%, primarily due to higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a 1% decrease in retail banking revenues, primarily driven by lower fiduciary fees reflecting declines in equity market valuations.\\n\\nAsia Consumer (managed basis) revenues\\nDecreased 25%\\nPrimarily driven by the loss of revenues from the closing of the exit markets and the impacts of the ongoing Korea wind-down.\\n\\nLegacy Holdings Assets revenues of $(81) million decreased from $186 million in the prior year, largely driven by the CTA loss (net of hedges) recorded in AOCI, as well as the continued wind-down of Legacy Holdings Assets.\\n\\nCorporate/Other revenues were $1.5 billion, compared to $825 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. The higher net interest income was primarily due to the investment portfolio driven by higher balances, higher interest rates and lower mortgage-backed securities prepayments, partially offset by higher cost of funds related to higher institutional certificates of deposit. The lower non-interest revenue was primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains in the prior year as well as higher hedging costs.\\n\\nExpenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower consulting expenses, the impact of certain legal settlements and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets.\\n\\nProvisions were $498 million, compared to a benefit of $88 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a lower net ACL release, partially offset by lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 48%, primarily reflecting improved delinquencies in both Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer.\\n\\nThe net ACL release was $368 million, compared to a net ACL release of $1.7 billion in the prior year, driven by further improvement in portfolio credit quality.\\n---\\n## CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\nCurrent Regulatory Capital Standards\\n\\nCiti is subject to regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), in coordination with the OCC and FDIC, including the U.S. implementation of the Basel III rules (for information on potential changes to the Basel III rules, see \"Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments\" and \"Risk Factors—Strategic Risks\" below). These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.\\n\\n### Risk-Based Capital Ratios\\n\\nThe U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets.\\n\\n|Total risk-weighted assets under the Standardized Approach|Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches|\\n|---|---|\\n|Credit and market risk-weighted assets|Credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets|\\n\\nAs a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are currently calculated on a generally consistent basis under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Standardized Approach does not include operational risk-weighted assets.\\n\\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, Citigroup is required to maintain several regulatory capital buffers above the stated minimum capital requirements to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. Accordingly, for the fourth quarter of 2023, Citigroup’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio was 12.3% under the Standardized Approach (incorporating its Stress Capital Buffer of 4.3% and GSIB (Global Systemically Important Bank) surcharge of 3.5%) and 10.5% under the Advanced Approaches (inclusive of the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and GSIB surcharge of 3.5%).\\n\\nSimilarly, Citigroup’s primary subsidiary, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital ratios plus applicable regulatory buffers, as well as hold sufficient capital to be considered “well capitalized” under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. In effect, Citibank’s required CET1 Capital ratio was 7.0% under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, which is the sum of the minimum 4.5% CET1 requirement and a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer.\\n\\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the Dodd-Frank Act (the so-called “Collins Amendment”), which requires banking organizations to calculate “generally applicable” capital requirements. As a result, Citi must calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital) under both the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and comply with the more binding of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.\\n\\n## Capital Management\\n\\nCiti’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets, and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate its capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength.\\n\\nThe Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy for Citigroup’s subsidiaries, is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable.\\n\\nFor additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” below.\\n---\\n## Leverage Ratio\\n\\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, Citigroup is also required to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 4.0%. Similarly, Citibank is required to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 5.0% to be considered “well capitalized” under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\\n\\n### Supplementary Leverage Ratio\\n\\nCiti is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR), which differs from the Leverage ratio by including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The SLR represents end-of-period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure. Total Leverage Exposure is defined as the sum of (i) the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and (ii) the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum SLR of 3.0%.\\n\\n### Regulatory Capital Buffers\\n\\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to maintain several regulatory capital buffers above the stated minimum capital requirements. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements.\\n\\n### Stress Capital Buffer\\n\\nCitigroup is subject to the FRB’s Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) rule, which integrates the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The SCB equals the peak-to-trough CET1 Capital ratio decline under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario over a nine-quarter period used in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. SCB-based capital requirements are reviewed and updated annually by the FRB as part of the CCAR process.\\n\\n### Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology\\n\\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that modified the regulatory capital transition provision related to the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The rule does not have any impact on U.S. GAAP accounting. The rule permitted banks to delay for two years the “Day One” adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology on January 1, 2020 until January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition to phase out the regulatory capital benefit provided by the delay.\\n---\\napplicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation The following table presents Citi’s effective GSIB\\nBuffer, is unaffected by Citigroup’s SCB. surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 during\\n2023 and 2022:\\n\\n| |2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Method 1|2.0 %|2.0 %|\\n|Method 2|3.5|3.0|\\n\\nCapital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Capital Buffer\\n\\nCitigroup is subject to a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under the Advanced Approaches. Citibank is subject to the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach.\\n\\nIn addition, Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citigroup and Citibank, are subject to a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer is currently set at 0% by the U.S. banking agencies.\\n\\nCiti’s GSIB surcharge effective during 2023 was 3.5% and during 2022 was 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2024 remains unchanged at 3.5%, as derived under the higher method 2 result.\\n\\nCiti expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge. Accordingly, based on Citi’s method 2 result as of December 31, 2022 and its estimated method 2 result as of December 31, 2023, Citi’s GSIB surcharge is expected to remain at 3.5% effective January 1, 2025.\\n\\nGSIB Surcharge\\n\\nThe FRB imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as GSIBs, including Citi (for information on potential changes to the GSIB surcharge, see “Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below). The GSIB surcharge augments the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.\\n\\nA U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category under the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges calculated during 2024 will be based on 2023 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi’s surcharge determined under method 2 will be higher than its surcharge determined under method 1.\\n\\nShould a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year, such that it becomes subject to a higher GSIB surcharge, the higher surcharge would become effective on January 1 of the year that is one full calendar year after the increased GSIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated in 2024 using data as of December 31, 2023 would not become effective until January 1, 2026). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge on January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year in which the decreased GSIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated in 2024 using data as of December 31, 2023 would become effective January 1, 2025).\\n\\nPrompt Corrective Action Framework\\n\\nIn general, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,” (ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) “undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”\\n\\nAccordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0%, and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” In addition, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.” Citibank was “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\nFurthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and not be subject to a FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels.\\n\\nStress Testing Component of Capital Planning\\n\\nCiti is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).\\n\\nFor the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a qualitative evaluation of a firm’s abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. In conducting the qualitative assessment, the FRB evaluates\\n---\\nfirms’ capital planning practices, focusing on six areas of Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected capital planning: governance, risk management, internal revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios controls, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules.\\n\\nIn addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.\\n\\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to disclose the results of their company-run stress tests.\\n\\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common share repurchases. The FRB assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks.\\n\\nAll CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.\\n\\nDFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the FRB and the general public as to how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the FRB. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the FRB.\\n---\\n## Citigroup’s Capital Resources\\n\\n| |Advanced Approaches| |Standardized Approach| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |December 31|September 30|December 31|December 31|September 30|December 31|\\n|CET1 Capital ratio (2)|2023 10.5%|2023 10.5%|2022 10.0%|2023 12.3%|2023 12.0%|2022 11.5%|\\n|Tier 1 Capital ratio (2)|12.0|12.0|11.5|13.8|13.5|13.0|\\n|Total Capital ratio (2)|14.0|14.0|13.5|15.8|15.5|15.0|\\n\\n(1) As of October 1, 2023, Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio increased from 12.0% to 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.3% SCB and its current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%.\\n\\n(2) Beginning January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, Citi’s required risk-based capital ratios included the 4.0% SCB and 3.5% GSIB surcharge under the Standardized Approach, and the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and 3.5% GSIB surcharge under the Advanced Approaches (all of which must be composed of CET1 Capital).

The decrease in the CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches was also driven by an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA.\\n\\nCiti’s CET1 Capital ratio increased under the Standardized Approach and decreased under the Advanced Approaches from year-end 2022. The increase in the CET1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach was driven by increases in CET1 Capital primarily from net income of $9.2 billion, beneficial net movements in AOCI and impacts from the sales of Asia Consumer businesses, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders, higher deferred tax assets and an increase in Standardized Approach RWA. The decrease in the CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches was driven by an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA, partially offset by the increases in CET1 Capital.\\n---\\n## Components of Citigroup Capital\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|CET1 Capital| | |\\n|Citigroup common stockholders’ equity (1)|$187,937|$182,325|\\n|Add: Qualifying noncontrolling interests|153|128|\\n|Regulatory capital adjustments and deductions:| | |\\n|Add: CECL transition provision (2)|1,514|2,271|\\n|Less: Accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, net of tax|(1,406)|(2,522)|\\n|Less: Cumulative unrealized net gain (loss) related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to own creditworthiness, net of tax|(410)|1,441|\\n|Less: Intangible assets:| | |\\n|Goodwill, net of related DTLs (3)|18,778|19,007|\\n|Identifiable intangible assets other than MSRs, net of related DTLs|3,349|3,411|\\n|Less: Defined benefit pension plan net assets and other|1,317|1,935|\\n|Less: DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards (4)|12,075|12,197|\\n|Less: Excess over 10%/15% limitations for other DTAs, certain common stock investments, and MSRs (4)(5)|2,306|325|\\n|Total CET1 Capital (Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches)|$153,595|$148,930|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Additional Tier 1 Capital| | |\\n|Qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (1)|$17,516|$18,864|\\n|Qualifying trust preferred securities (6)|1,413|1,406|\\n|Qualifying noncontrolling interests|29|30|\\n|Regulatory capital deductions:| | |\\n|Less: Other|49|85|\\n|Total Additional Tier 1 Capital (Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches)|$18,909|$20,215|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total Tier 1 Capital (CET1 Capital + Additional Tier 1 Capital) (Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches)|$172,504|$169,145|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Tier 2 Capital| | |\\n|Qualifying subordinated debt|$16,137|$15,530|\\n|Qualifying noncontrolling interests|37|37|\\n|Eligible allowance for credit losses (2)(7)|13,703|13,426|\\n|Regulatory capital deduction:| | |\\n|Less: Other|613|595|\\n|Total Tier 2 Capital (Standardized Approach)|$29,264|$28,398|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) (Standardized Approach)|$201,768|$197,543|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Adjustment for excess of eligible credit reserves over expected credit losses (2)(7)|($9,849)|($8,704)|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total Tier 2 Capital (Advanced Approaches)|$19,415|$19,694|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) (Advanced Approaches)|$191,919|$188,839|\\n\\n(1) Issuance costs of $84 million and $131 million related to outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with FRB regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.\\n\\n(2) Citi’s regulatory capital ratios and components reflect certain deferrals based on the modified regulatory capital transition provision related to the CECL standard.

This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets, or Total Leverage Exposure.

The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational risk-weighted asset amounts.\\n\\nIf adopted as proposed, the capital proposal’s impact on risk-weighted asset amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external long-term debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see “GSIB Surcharge” below). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. If finalized as proposed, the capital proposal would have a material adverse impact on Citi’s required regulatory capital.\\n\\nFor information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital requirements, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Compliance Risks”\\n\\nGSIB Surcharge\\n\\nSeparately on July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year’s surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands.\\n\\nLong-Term Debt Requirements\\n\\nOn August 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, only 50% of eligible long-term debt with a maturity of one year or more but less than two years would count toward the TLAC requirement, instead of the current 100%. These proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. The proposed rule in its current form has no proposed transition period for its implementation and is not expected to be material to Citi.\\n---\\n## Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity\\n\\nTangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes TCE, TBVPS and RoTCE provide alternative measures of capital strength and performance for investors, industry analysts and others.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars or shares, except per share amounts|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total Citigroup stockholders’ equity|$205,453|$201,189|$201,972|$199,442|$193,242|\\n|Less: Preferred stock|17,600|18,995|18,995|19,480|17,980|\\n|Common stockholders’ equity|$187,853|$182,194|$182,977|$179,962|$175,262|\\n|Less:| | | | | |\\n|Goodwill|20,098|19,691|21,299|22,162|22,126|\\n|Identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs)|3,730|3,763|4,091|4,411|4,327|\\n|Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) related to assets held-for-sale (HFS)| |589|510| | |\\n|Tangible common equity (TCE)|$164,025|$158,151|$157,077|$153,389|$148,809|\\n|Common shares outstanding (CSO)|1,903.1|1,937.0|1,984.4|2,082.1|2,114.1|\\n|Book value per share (common stockholders’ equity/CSO)|$98.71|$94.06|$92.21|$86.43|$82.90|\\n|Tangible book value per share (TCE/CSO)|86.19|81.65|79.16|73.67|70.39|\\n\\n|For the year ended December 31,|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Net income available to common shareholders|$8,030|$13,813|$20,912|$9,952|$18,292|\\n|Average common stockholders’ equity|$187,730|$180,093|$182,421|$175,508|$177,363|\\n|Less:| | | | | |\\n|Average goodwill|20,313|19,354|21,771|21,315|21,903|\\n|Average intangible assets (other than MSRs)|3,835|3,924|4,244|4,301|4,466|\\n|Average goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) related to assets HFS|226|872|153| | |\\n|Average TCE|$163,356|$155,943|$156,253|$149,892|$150,994|\\n|Return on average common stockholders’ equity|4.3%|7.7%|11.5%|5.7%|10.3%|\\n|RoTCE|4.9|8.9|13.4|6.6|12.1|\\n---\\n## RISK FACTORS\\n\\nThe following discussion presents what management currently believes could be the material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to Citi or its management, could also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties that Citi may face. For additional information about risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi, see “Executive Summary” and each respective business’s results of operations above and “Managing Global Risk” below. The following risk factors are categorized to improve the readability and usefulness of the risk factor disclosure, and, while the headings and risk factors generally align with Citi’s risk categorization, in certain instances the risk factors may not directly correspond with how Citi categorizes or manages its risks.\\n\\n### MARKET-RELATED RISKS\\n\\nMacroeconomic, Geopolitical and Other Challenges and Uncertainties Could Continue to Have a Negative Impact on Citi.\\n\\nCiti has experienced, and could experience in the future, negative impacts to its businesses, results of operations and financial condition as a result of various macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, uncertainties and volatility. These include, among other things, government fiscal and monetary actions or expected actions, including continued high interest rates, reductions in central bank balance sheets, or other restrictive interest rate or other monetary policies; potential recessions in the U.S., Europe and other regions or countries; and elevated levels of inflation.\\n\\nFor example, in 2023, the U.S., the U.K., the EU and other economies continued to experience elevated levels of inflation. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and other central banks substantially raised interest rates, reduced the size of their balance sheets and took other actions in an aggressive effort to curb inflation. These actions may continue to adversely impact certain sectors sensitive to interest rates and consumer discretionary spending. They may also slow economic growth, increase the risk of recession and increase the unemployment rate in the U.S. and other countries, all of which would likely adversely affect Citi’s consumer and institutional clients, businesses and results of operations. In addition, inflation may continue to result in higher labor and other costs, thus putting further pressure on Citi’s expenses.\\n\\nMore recently, the FRB has signaled that it expects to reduce the benchmark U.S. interest rate in 2024. If the FRB were to reduce interest rates prematurely, inflation could resurge.\\n\\nInterest rates on loans Citi makes are typically based off or set at a spread over a benchmark interest rate and would likely decline or rise as benchmark rates decline or rise, respectively. For example, while a decline in interest rates would generally be expected to result in lower overall net interest income, it could improve Citi’s funding costs. Although higher interest rates would generally be expected to increase overall net interest income, higher rates could adversely affect funding costs, levels of deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or product revenues. In addition, Citi’s net interest income could be adversely affected due to a flattening (a lower spread between shorter-term versus longer-term interest rates) or longer lasting or more severe inversion (shorter-term interest rates exceeding longer-term interest rates) of the interest rate yield curve, as Citi typically pays interest on deposits based on shorter-term interest rates and earns money on loans based on longer-term interest rates. For additional information on Citi’s interest rate risk, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Banking Book Interest Rate Risk” below. Additionally, Citi’s balance sheet includes interest-rate sensitive fixed-rate assets such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency securities and residential mortgages, among others, whose valuation would be adversely impacted in a higher-rate environment and/or whose hedging costs may increase.\\n\\nAdditional areas of uncertainty include, among others, geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts, including those related to Russia’s war in Ukraine (see discussion below), as well as a persistent and/or escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly if the conflict were to widen to involve additional combatants, countries or regions; economic and other geopolitical challenges related to China, including weak economic growth, related policy actions, challenges in the Chinese real estate sector, banking and credit markets, and tensions or conflicts between China and Taiwan and/or China and the U.S.; significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets, including foreign currency volatility and devaluations and continued strength in the U.S. dollar; protracted or widespread trade tensions; natural disasters; new pandemics, including new COVID-19 variants; and political polarization, election outcomes and the effects of divided government, such as with respect to any extended government shutdown in the U.S. For example, Citi’s market-making businesses can suffer losses resulting from the widening of credit spreads due to unanticipated changes in financial markets. Moreover, adverse developments or downturns in one or more of the world’s larger economies would likely have a significant impact on the global economy or the economies of other countries because of global financial and economic linkages.\\n\\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has caused supply shocks in energy, food and other commodities markets, worsened inflation, increased cybersecurity risks, increased the risk of recession in Europe and heightened geopolitical tensions. Actions by Russia, and any further measures taken by the U.S. or its allies, could continue to have negative impacts on regional and global energy and other commodities and financial markets and macroeconomic conditions, adversely impacting jurisdictions where Citi operates and has customers, clients or employees. Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject Citi to various other risks, among which are foreign currency volatility, including appreciations or devaluations; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its remaining businesses, including, without limitation, its provision to its customers of certain securities services; sanctions or asset freezes; and other deconsolidation events. In the event of a loss of control of AO Citibank, Citi would be required to write off its net investment.\\n---\\nin the entity, recognize a CTA loss through earnings and weighted assets. Under the capital proposal, a single capital recognize a loss on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside of Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. For additional information about these risks, see the operational processes and systems, cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\\n\\nCiti’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders Substantially Depends on Regulatory Capital Requirements, Including the Results of the CCAR Process and Dodd-Frank Act Regulatory Stress Tests, and Other Factors.\\n\\nCiti’s ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, whether through its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program, substantially depends, among other things, on its regulatory capital requirements, including the annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), which is based upon the results of the CCAR process required by the FRB, and recalibration of the GSIB surcharge, as well as the supervisory expectations and assessments regarding individual institutions.\\n\\nThe FRB’s annual stress testing requirements are integrated into ongoing regulatory capital requirements. Citi’s SCB equals the maximum projected decline in its CET1 Capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario over a nine-quarter CCAR measurement period, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of Citi’s risk-weighted assets, subject to a minimum requirement of 2.5%. The SCB is calculated by the FRB using its proprietary data and modeling of each firm’s results. Accordingly, Citi’s SCB may change annually, based on the supervisory stress test results, thus potentially resulting in variability in the calculation of Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach. On October 1, 2023, Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio increased to 12.3% from 12% under the Standardized Approach, reflecting the increase in the SCB requirement to 4.3% from 4.0%. In addition, a breach of the SCB and other regulatory capital buffers may result in gradual limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. For additional information on the SCB, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Buffers” above.\\n\\nMoreover, changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations could materially increase Citi’s required regulatory capital. For example, the U.S. banking regulators have proposed a number of changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework, including, but not limited to, significant revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal); changes to the method for calculating the GSIB surcharge; and changes to aspects of the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements. The capital proposal would replace the Advanced Approaches with a new Expanded Risk-based Approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Under the capital proposal, a single capital buffer, including the SCB, would apply to a firm’s risk-based capital ratios, regardless of whether the applicable ratios result from the Expanded Risk-based Approach or the Modified Standardized Approach. Additionally, the capital proposal would make various changes to the calculations of credit risk, market risk and operational risk components of risk-weighted assets (see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” above). All of these potential changes, if adopted as proposed, would likely materially impact Citi’s regulatory capital position and substantially increase Citi’s regulatory capital requirements, and thus adversely impact the extent to which Citi is able to return capital to shareholders.\\n\\nCiti’s ability to return capital also depends on its results of operations and financial condition, including the capital impact related to its remaining divestitures, such as, among other things, any temporary capital impact from CTA losses (net of hedges) between transaction signings and closings (see the continued investments and the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factors below); Citi’s effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach, as well as the Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR); its implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning process and management framework; forecasts of macroeconomic conditions; and deferred tax asset (DTA) utilization (see the ability to utilize DTA risk factor below). The FRB could also limit or prohibit capital actions, such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock due to macroeconomic disruptions or events, some of which occurred for a period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAll firms subject to CCAR requirements, including Citi, will continue to be subject to a rigorous regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices and other reviews and examinations, including, but not limited to data quality, which is a key regulatory focus, governance, risk management and internal controls. For example, the FRB has stated that it expects capital adequacy practices to continue to evolve and to likely be determined by its yearly cross-firm review of capital plan submissions. Similarly, the FRB has indicated that, as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing requirements, several parameters of the annual stress testing process may continue to be altered, including the number and severity of the stress test scenarios, the FRB modeling of Citi’s balance sheet, pre-provision net revenue and stress losses, and the addition of components deemed important by the FRB. Additionally, Citi’s ability to return capital may be adversely impacted if a regulatory evaluation or examination results in negative findings regarding absolute capital levels or other aspects of Citi’s operations, including as a result of the imposition of additional capital buffers, limitations on capital distributions or otherwise. For information on limitations on Citi’s ability to return capital to common shareholders, as well as the CCAR process, supervisory stress test requirements and GSIB surcharge, see “Capital Resources—Overview” and “Capital Resources—Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” above and the risk management risk factor below.\\n---\\nIn December 2023, the FRB announced that it will maintain its current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the 2024 stress test cycle, while continuing to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this framework. The impacts on Citi’s capital adequacy of any potential incorporation by the FRB of CECL into its supervisory stress tests in future stress test cycles, and of other potential regulatory changes in the FRB’s stress testing methodologies, remain unclear. For additional information regarding the CECL methodology, including the transition provisions related to the adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” above and Note 1.\\n\\nAlthough various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of, and the ultimate impact to Citi from, changes to regulatory capital, results from the FRB’s stress testing and CCAR regimes, and regulatory evaluation or examination findings, these changes could increase the level of capital Citi is required or elects to hold, including as part of Citi’s management buffer, thus potentially adversely impacting the extent to which Citi is able to return capital to shareholders.\\n\\nCiti Must Continually Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing Regulatory and Legislative Uncertainties and Changes in the U.S. and Globally.\\n\\nCiti, its management and its businesses continue to face regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes, both in the U.S. and globally. While the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes facing Citi are too numerous to list completely, examples include, but are not limited to (i) potential changes to various aspects of the U.S. regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to Citi, including, among others, significant revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules, known as the Basel III Endgame; (ii) potential fiscal, monetary, tax, sanctions and other changes promulgated by the U.S. federal government and other governments, including potential changes in regulatory requirements relating to interest rate risk management; and (iii) rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory requirements and other government initiatives in the EU, the U.S. and globally related to climate change and other ESG areas that vary, and may conflict, across jurisdictions, including any new disclosure requirements.\\n\\nCiti’s Ability to Achieve Its Objectives from Its Transformation, Organizational, Simplification and Other Strategic and Other Initiatives May Not Be as Successful as It Projects or Expects.\\n\\nAs part of its transformation initiatives, Citi continues to make significant investments to improve its risk and controls environment, modernize its data and technology infrastructure and further enhance safety and soundness. Citi also continues to make business-led investments, as part of the execution of its strategic initiatives. Additionally, Citi has been pursuing overall simplification initiatives that include management and operating model changes and actions to enhance focus on clients and reduce expenses. Citi’s simplification actions also include divestiture of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations and completing other exits and wind-downs in order to streamline Citi and assist in optimizing its allocation of resources. These overall simplification initiatives involve various execution challenges and may result in higher than expected expenses, litigation and regulatory scrutiny, CTA and other losses or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be material.\\n\\nFor example, in February 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed significant changes to the maximum amounts on credit card late fees, which, if adopted as proposed, would reduce credit card fee revenues in Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB. In addition, U.S. and international regulatory and legislative initiatives have not always been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis, and areas of divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to their scope, interpretation, timing, structure or approach, leading to inconsistent or even conflicting requirements, including within a single jurisdiction.\\n\\nFurther, ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes make Citi’s long-term business, balance sheet and strategic budget planning difficult, subject to change and potentially more costly and may impact its results of operations. U.S. and other regulators globally have implemented and continue to discuss various changes to certain regulatory requirements, which would require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact to Citi, its businesses and business planning. Business planning must necessarily be based on possible or proposed rules or outcomes, which can change significantly upon finalization, or upon implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies worldwide, and such guidance can change. Regulatory and legislative changes have also significantly increased Citi’s compliance risks and costs and can adversely affect Citi’s competitive position, as well as its businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\\n---\\nreturn risk factor above and the incorrect assumptions or due to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Failure to estimates risk factor below).\\n\\nCiti’s multiyear transformation, as well as its simplification initiatives, involve significant complexities and uncertainties. In addition, there is inherent risk that Citi’s transformation and simplification initiatives will not be as productive or effective as Citi expects, or at all. Conversely, failure to adequately invest in and upgrade Citi’s technology and processes or properly implement its enterprise-wide simplification could result in Citi’s inability to meet regulatory expectations, be sufficiently competitive, serve clients effectively and avoid disruptions to its businesses and operational errors (see the operational processes and systems and legal and regulatory proceedings risk factors below). Citi’s ability to achieve expected returns and operational improvements depends, in part, on factors that it cannot control, including, among others, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties; customer, client and competitor actions; and ongoing regulatory requirements or changes.\\n\\nCiti’s transformation, strategic and other initiatives may continue to evolve as its business strategies, the market environment and regulatory expectations change, which could make the initiatives more costly and more challenging to implement, and limit their effectiveness.\\n\\nClimate Change Presents Various Financial and Non-Financial Risks to Citi and Its Customers and Clients. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to Citi and its customers and clients, with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risks can arise from both physical risks (those risks related to the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to regulatory, market, technological, stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy). Physical and transition risks can manifest themselves differently across Citi’s risk categories in the short, medium and long terms.\\n\\nPhysical risks from climate change include acute risks, such as hurricanes, floods and droughts, as well as consequences of chronic changes in climate, such as rising sea levels, prolonged droughts and systemic changes to geographies and any resulting population migration. For example, physical risks could have adverse financial, operational and other impacts on Citi, both directly on its business and operations, and indirectly as a result of impacts to Citi’s clients, customers, vendors and other counterparties. These impacts can include destruction, damage or impairment of owned or leased properties and other assets, destruction or deterioration of the value of collateral, such as real estate, disruptions to business operations and supply chains and reduced availability or increase in the cost of insurance.\\n\\nTransition risks may arise from changes in regulations or market preferences toward low-carbon industries or sectors, which in turn could have negative impacts on asset values, results of operations or the reputations of Citi and its customers and clients. For example, Citi’s corporate credit exposures include oil and gas, power and other industries that may experience reduced demand for carbon-intensive products\\n\\nCiti’s ability to adequately consider transition risk in developing and executing on its business strategy could lead to a loss of market share, lower revenues and higher credit costs. Transition risks also include potential increased operational, compliance and energy costs driven by government policies to promote decarbonization.\\n\\nMoreover, increasing legislative and regulatory changes and uncertainties regarding climate-related risk management and disclosures are likely to result in increased regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs for Citi. New regulations have been enacted and/or are expected in several jurisdictions, including the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the SEC climate-related disclosures that could require disclosure of climate-related information and the State of California’s legislation enacted in October 2023 requiring broad disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related information largely beginning in 2026. In addition, Citi could face increased regulatory scrutiny and reputation and litigation risks as a result of its climate risk, sustainability and other ESG-related commitments and disclosures.\\n\\nEven as some regulators seek to mandate additional disclosure of climate-related information, Citi’s ability to comply with such requirements and conduct more robust climate-related risk analyses may be hampered by lack of information and reliable data. Data on climate-related risks is limited in availability, often based on estimated or unverified figures, collected and reported on a time-lag, and variable in quality. Modeling capabilities to analyze climate-related risks and interconnections are improving, but remain incomplete. U.S. and non-U.S. banking regulators and others are increasingly focusing on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions, both directly and with respect to their clients. For example, in October 2023, the FRB, FDIC and OCC jointly released principles that provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks, including physical and transition risks, for financial institutions with more than $100 billion in assets.\\n\\nAdditionally, if Citi’s response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient or Citi is unable to achieve its objectives or commitments relating to climate change, its businesses, reputation, attractiveness to certain investors and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer. For example, Citi\\'s approach to supporting client decarbonization in a gradual and orderly way, while promoting energy security, may lead to both continued exposure to carbon-intensive activity and increased reputation risks from stakeholders with divergent points of view. Citi also faces anti-ESG challenges from certain U.S. state and other governments that may impact its ability to conduct certain business within those jurisdictions.\\n\\nFor information on Citi’s climate and other sustainability initiatives, see “Climate Change and Net Zero” below. For additional information on Citi’s management of climate risk, see “Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—Climate Risk” below.\\n---\\n## Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the Negative Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital\\n\\nWill Be Driven by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable Income.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, Citi’s net DTAs were $29.6 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $3.6 billion, of which $12.8 billion was deducted from Citi’s CET1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Of this deducted amount, $12.1 billion related to net operating losses, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, with $2.3 billion related to temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $1.6 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital.\\n\\nCiti’s overall ability to realize its DTAs will primarily be dependent upon Citi’s ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant reversal periods. Failure to realize any portion of the net DTAs would have a corresponding negative impact on Citi’s net income and financial returns.\\n\\nThe accounting treatment for realization of DTAs is complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax planning strategies. Forecasts of future taxable earnings will depend upon various factors, including, among others, macroeconomic conditions. In addition, any future increase in U.S. corporate tax rates could result in an increase in Citi’s DTAs, which may subject more of Citi’s DTAs to exclusion from regulatory capital.\\n\\nCiti has not been and does not expect to be subject to the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which, if applicable to Citi in any given year, would have a significantly adverse effect on both Citi’s net income and regulatory capital.\\n\\nFor additional information on Citi’s DTAs, including FTCs, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 10.\\n\\n## Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Complex Tax Laws to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in Litigation or Examinations and the Payment of Additional Taxes, Penalties or Interest.\\n\\nCiti is subject to various income-based tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as the numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are inherently complex, and Citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to its entities, operations, and businesses.\\n\\nFor example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2 initiative contemplates a 15% global minimum tax with respect to earnings in each country. EU member states were required to adopt the OECD Pillar 2 rules in 2023, with an effective date of January 1, 2024 (unless an exception applied), and other non-U.S. countries have similarly adopted or are expected to adopt the rules.\\n\\nUnder these rules, Citi will be required to pay a “top-up” tax to the extent that Citi’s effective tax rate in any given country is below 15%. Beginning in 2024, countries that adopted the OECD Pillar 2 rules in 2023 can collect the top-up tax only with respect to earnings of entities in their jurisdiction or subsidiaries of such entities. Beginning in 2025, all countries that have adopted the OECD Pillar 2 rules can collect a share of the top-up tax owed with respect to any member of the Pillar 2 multinational group.\\n\\nWhile Citi does not currently expect the rules to have a material impact on its earnings, many aspects of the application of the rules remain uncertain. Additionally, Citi is subject to litigation or examinations with U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding non-income-based tax matters. While Citi has appropriately reserved for such matters where there is a probable loss, and has disclosed reasonably possible losses, the outcome of the matters may be different than Citi’s expectations. Citi’s interpretations or application of the tax laws, including with respect to withholding, stamp, service, and other non-income taxes, could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which could result in the requirement to pay additional taxes, penalties or interest, the reduction of certain tax benefits or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded, which could be material. See Note 30 for additional information on litigation and examinations involving non-U.S. tax authorities.\\n\\n## A Deterioration in or Failure to Maintain Citi’s Co-Branding or Private Label Credit Card Relationships Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi.\\n\\nCiti has co-branding and private label relationships through its Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card businesses with various retailers and merchants, whereby in the ordinary course of business Citi issues credit cards to consumers, including customers of the retailers or merchants. The five largest relationships across both businesses in USPB constituted an aggregate of approximately 11% of Citi’s revenues in 2023 (see “U.S. Personal Banking” above). Citi’s co-branding and private label agreements often provide for shared economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term.\\n\\nCompetition among card issuers, including Citi, for these relationships is significant, and Citi may not be able to maintain such relationships on existing terms or at all. Citi’s co-branding and private label relationships could also be negatively impacted by, among other things, the general economic environment, including the impacts of continued elevated interest rates and inflation, and lower economic growth rates, as well as a continuing risk of recession; changes in consumer sentiment, spending patterns, and credit card usage behaviors; a decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures, any reduction in air and business travel, or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant; early termination due to a contractual breach or exercise of other early termination right; or other factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations, or other similar events, whether due to a challenging macroeconomic environment or otherwise.\\n\\nThese events, particularly early termination and bankruptcies or liquidations, could negatively impact the results of operations or financial condition of Branded Cards, Retail Services, or Citi as a whole, including as a result of loss of revenues, increased expenses, higher cost of credit, impairment of purchased credit card relationships and contract-related intangibles or other losses (see Note 17 for information on Citi’s credit card related intangibles generally).\\n---\\nThe Application of U.S. Resolution Plan Requirements May Pose a Greater Risk of Loss to Citi’s Debt and Equity Securities Holders, and Citi’s Inability in Its Resolution Plan Submissions to Address Any Shortcomings or Deficiencies or Guidance Could Subject Citi to More Stringent Capital, Leverage or Liquidity Requirements, or Restrictions on Its Growth, Activities or Operations, and Could Eventually Require Citi to Divest Assets or Operations.\\n\\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to prepare and submit a plan to the FRB and the FDIC for the orderly resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding company) and its significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of future material financial distress or failure.\\n\\nUnder Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal entities (as defined in the public section of its 2023 resolution plan, which can be found on the FRB’s and FDIC’s websites) would remain operational outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings. As a result, Citigroup’s losses and any losses incurred by its material legal entity subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of Citigroup’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible long-term debt and other debt securities.\\n\\nIn addition, a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Citigroup serves as a resolution funding vehicle (the IHC) to which Citigroup has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets. The obligations of Citigroup and of the IHC, respectively, under the amended and restated secured support agreement, are secured on a senior basis by the assets of Citigroup (other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets), and the assets of the IHC, as applicable. As a result, claims of the operating material legal entities against the assets of Citigroup with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of Citigroup. Citi’s single point of entry resolution plan strategy and the obligations under the amended and restated secured support agreement may result in the recapitalization of and/or provision of liquidity to Citi’s operating material legal entities, and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by Citigroup at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place.\\n\\nIn line with the FRB’s TLAC rule, Citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured long-term debt holders—would bear any losses resulting from Citigroup’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by holders of its unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup. For additional information on Citi’s single point of entry resolution plan strategy and the IHC and secured support agreement, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.\\n\\nOn November 22, 2022, the FRB and FDIC issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1, 2021 by the eight U.S. GSIBs, including Citi. The FRB and FDIC identified one shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citi’s 2021 resolution plan. The shortcoming related to data integrity and data quality management issues, specifically, weaknesses in Citi’s processes and practices for producing certain data that could materially impact its resolution capabilities. If a shortcoming is not satisfactorily explained or addressed before, or in, the submission of the next resolution plan, the shortcoming may be found to be a deficiency in the next resolution plan (see discussion below). Citi submitted its 2023 resolution plan in June 2023. More generally, data continues to be a subject of regulatory focus, and Citi continues to work on enhancing its data availability and quality.\\n\\nUnder Title I, if the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine that Citi’s resolution plan is not “credible” (which, although not defined, is generally understood to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow Citi to be resolved in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption), or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of Citi under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and Citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified deficiencies, Citi could be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on its growth, activities or operations. If within two years from the imposition of any such requirements or restrictions Citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies, then Citi could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. Any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact Citi’s reputation, market and investor perception, operations and strategy.\\n\\nCiti’s Performance and Its Ability to Effectively Execute Its Transformation and Strategic and Other Initiatives Could Be Negatively Impacted if It Is Not Able to Hire and Retain Qualified Employees.\\n\\nCiti’s performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely depend on the talents and efforts of its diverse and highly qualified colleagues. Specifically, Citi’s continued ability to compete in each of its lines of business, to manage its businesses effectively and to execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives, including, for example, hiring front office colleagues to grow businesses or hiring colleagues to support Citi’s transformation and strategic and other initiatives, depends on its ability to attract new colleagues and to retain and motivate its existing colleagues. If Citi is unable to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified colleagues, Citi’s performance, including its competitive position, the execution of its transformation and strategic and other initiatives and its results of operations could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nCiti’s ability to attract, retain and motivate colleagues depends on numerous factors, some of which are outside of Citi’s control. For example, the competition for talent continues to be particularly intense due to factors such as low unemployment and changes in worker expectations, concerns and preferences, including an increased demand for remote work options and other job flexibility. Also, the banking industry generally is subject to more comprehensive regulation of employee compensation than other industries, including deferral and clawback requirements for incentive compensation, which can make it unusually challenging for Citi to compete in labor markets against businesses, including, for example, technology companies, that are not subject to such regulations.\\n---\\nsuch regulation. In addition, in 2023 Citi announced plans to market entrants. Simultaneously, as Citi develops new reduce management layers from 13 to a median of eight as part of organizational simplification initiatives that also involve significant reductions in functional roles, which could also impact its ability to attract and retain colleagues. Other factors that could impact its ability to attract, retain and motivate colleagues include, among other things, Citi’s presence in a particular market or region, the professional and development opportunities, its reputation and its diversity. For information on Citi’s colleagues and workforce management, see “Human Capital Resources and Management” below.\\n\\nCiti Faces Increased Competitive Challenges, Including from Financial Services and Other Companies and Emerging Technologies.\\n\\nCiti operates in an increasingly evolving and competitive business environment, which includes both financial and non-financial services firms, such as traditional banks, online banks, private credit and financial technology companies and others. These companies compete on the basis of, among other factors, size, reach, quality and type of products and services offered, price, technology and reputation. Certain competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent legal and regulatory requirements, whether due to size, jurisdiction, entity type or other factors, placing Citi at a competitive disadvantage.\\n\\nFor example, Citi competes with other financial services companies in the U.S. and globally that have grown rapidly over the last several years or have developed and introduced new products and services. Potential mergers and acquisitions involving traditional financial services companies such as regional banks or credit card issuers, as well as networks and merchant acquirers, may also increase competition and impact Citi’s ability to offer competitive pricing and rewards. Non-traditional financial services firms, such as private credit and financial technology companies, are less regulated and continue to expand their offerings of services traditionally provided by financial institutions. The growth of certain of these competitors has increased market and counterparty credit risks, particularly in a more challenging macroeconomic environment. In addition, emerging technologies have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry.\\n\\nIncreased competition and emerging technologies have required and could require Citi to change or adapt its products and services, as well as invest in and develop related infrastructure, to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively with competitors, including new market entrants. Simultaneously, as Citi develops new products and services leveraging emerging technologies, new risks may emerge that, if not designed and governed adequately, may result in control gaps and in Citi operating outside of its risk appetite. For example, failure to strategically embrace the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) may result in a competitive disadvantage to Citi. At the same time, as a new technology, use of AI without sufficient controls, governance and risk management may result in increased risks across all of Citi’s risk categories. As another example, instant and 24x7 payments products could be accompanied by challenges to forecasting and managing liquidity, as well as increased operational and compliance risks.\\n\\nMoreover, Citi relies on third parties to support certain of its product and service offerings, which may put Citi at a disadvantage to competitors who may directly offer a broader array of products and services. Also, Citi’s businesses, results of operations and reputation may suffer if any third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings, whether due to operational incidents or otherwise. To the extent that Citi is not able to compete effectively with financial services companies, including private credit and financial technology companies, and non-financial services firms, Citi could be placed at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in loss of customers and market share, and its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. For additional information on Citi’s competitors, see the co-brand and private label cards and qualified colleagues risk factors above and “Supervision, Regulation and Other—Competition” below.\\n\\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\\n\\nA Failure or Disruption of Citi’s Operational Processes or Systems Could Negatively Impact Its Reputation, Customers, Clients, Businesses or Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\\n\\nCiti’s global operations rely heavily on its technology systems and infrastructure, including the accurate, timely and secure processing, management, storage and transmission of data, including confidential transactions, and other information, as well as the monitoring of a substantial amount of data and complex transactions in real time. Citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and client-specific information for its consumer and institutional customers and clients, and must accurately record and reflect their account transactions. Citi’s operations must also comply with complex and evolving laws, regulations and heightened regulatory expectations in the countries in which it operates. With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the internet, mobile devices and cloud services to conduct financial transactions and customers’ and clients’ increasing use of online banking and trading systems and other platforms, large global financial institutions such as Citi have been, and will continue to be, subject to an ever-increasing risk of operational loss, failure or disruption.\\n---\\nAlthough Citi has continued to upgrade its technology, system or mobile banking platform), as well as the operations including systems to automate processes and gain efficiencies, of its clients, customers or other third parties. In addition, operational incidents are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources, not all of which are fully within Citi’s control. These include, among others, operational or execution failures, or deficiencies by third parties, including third parties that provide products or services to Citi (e.g., cloud service providers), other market participants or those that otherwise have an ongoing partnership or business relationship with Citi; deficiencies in processes or controls; inadequate management of data governance practices, data controls and monitoring mechanisms that may adversely impact internal or external reporting and decision-making; cyber or information security incidents (see the cybersecurity risk factor below); human error, such as manual transaction processing errors (e.g., erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by traders that cause system and market disruptions or losses), which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties; insufficient (or limited) straight-through processing between legacy or bespoke systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy or bespoke systems, leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; accidental system or technological failure; electrical or telecommunication outages; failures of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure, including cloud services; or other similar losses or damage to Citi’s property or assets (see also the climate change risk factor above).\\nFor example, operational incidents can arise as a result of failures by third parties with which Citi does business, such as failures by internet, mobile technology and cloud service providers or other vendors to adequately follow procedures or processes, safeguard their systems or prevent system disruptions or cyberattacks. Failure by Citi to develop, implement and operate a third-party risk management program commensurate with the level of risk, complexity and nature of its third-party relationships can also result in operational incidents. In addition, Citi has experienced and could experience further losses associated with manual transaction processing errors, including erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by Citi traders that cause system and market disruptions and losses for Citi and its clients. Irrespective of the sophistication of the technology utilized by Citi, there will always be some room for human and other errors. In view of the large transactions in which Citi engages, such errors could result in significant losses. While Citi has change management processes in place to appropriately upgrade its operational processes and systems to ensure that any changes introduced do not adversely impact security and operational continuity, such change management can fail or be ineffective.\\nFurthermore, when Citi introduces new products, systems or processes, new operational risks that may arise from those changes may not be identified, or adequate controls to mitigate the identified risks may not be appropriately implemented or operate as designed.\\nIncidents that impact information security, technology operations or other operational processes may cause disruptions and/or malfunctions within Citi’s businesses (e.g., the temporary loss of availability of Citi’s online banking\\n\\nCiti’s and Third Parties’ Computer Systems and Networks Will Continue to Be Susceptible to an Increasing Risk of Continually Evolving, Sophisticated Cybersecurity Incidents That Could Result in the Theft, Loss, Non-Availability, Misuse or Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer Information, Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs to Citi, Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.\\nCiti’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to ongoing attempted cyberattacks, such as unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, disruptions of service, phishing, malware, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious code and other similar events. These threats can arise from external parties, including cyber criminals, cyber terrorists, hacktivists (individuals or groups using cyberattacks to promote a political or social agenda) and nation-state actors, as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities. Citi develops its own software and relies on third-party applications and software, which are susceptible to vulnerability exploitations. Software leveraged in financial services and other industries continues to be impacted by an increasing number of zero-day vulnerabilities, thus increasing inherent cyber risk to Citi.\\nThe increasing use of mobile and other digital banking platforms and services, cloud technologies and connectivity solutions to facilitate remote working for Citi’s employees all increase Citi’s exposure to cybersecurity risks. Citi is also susceptible to cyberattacks given, among other things, its size and scale, high-profile brand, global footprint and prominent role in the financial system, as well as the ongoing wind-down of its businesses in Russia (see the macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factor above and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below). Additionally, Citi continues to operate in multiple jurisdictions in the midst of geopolitical unrest, including active conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, which could expose Citi to heightened risk of insider threat, politically motivated hacktivism or other cyber threats.\\n---\\nCiti continues to experience increased exposure to computing. Given the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks through third parties, in part because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses. Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which Citi’s customers do business, and any such third parties’ downstream service providers, also pose cybersecurity risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources certain functions, such as processing customer credit card transactions, uploading content on customer-facing websites and developing software for new products and services. These relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by third-party hosting of, or access to, Citi websites. This could lead to compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious code, resulting in security breaches or business disruptions impacting Citi customers, employees or operations. While many of Citi’s agreements with third parties include indemnification provisions, Citi may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under these provisions to adequately offset any losses and other adverse impacts Citi may incur from third-party cyber incidents.\\n\\nCiti and some of its third-party partners have been subjected to attempted and sometimes successful cyberattacks over the last several years, including (i) denial of service attacks, which attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers; (ii) hacking and malicious software installations intended to gain unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those systems and/or impact availability or privacy of confidential data, with objectives including, but not limited to, extortion payments or causing reputational damage; (iii) data breaches due to unauthorized access to customer account or other data; and (iv) malicious software attacks on client systems, in attempts to gain unauthorized access to Citi systems or client data under the guise of normal client transactions.\\n\\nWhile Citi’s monitoring and protection services have historically generally succeeded in detecting, thwarting and/or responding to attacks targeting its systems before they become significant, certain past incidents resulted in limited losses, as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently, via novel tactics, including leveraging of tools made possible by emerging technologies, and on a more significant scale. Despite the significant resources Citi allocates to implement, maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with measures such as intrusion detection and prevention systems and firewalls to safeguard critical business applications, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide sufficient security. Because the techniques used to initiate cyberattacks change frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched or even later, Citi may be unable to implement effective preventive measures or otherwise proactively address these methods. In addition, cyber threats and cyberattack techniques change, develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and quantum.\\n\\nChanges or Errors in Accounting Assumptions, Judgments or Estimates, or the Application of Certain Accounting Principles, Could Result in Significant Losses or Other Adverse Impacts.\\n\\nU.S. GAAP requires Citi to use certain assumptions, judgments and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including, among other items, the estimate of the ACL; reserves related to litigation, regulatory and tax matters; valuation of DTAs; the fair values of certain assets and liabilities; and the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in many circumstances, that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, nor can they anticipate the\\n\\nimpact of future events on Citi’s financial condition and operating results. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, judgments and estimates, and such differences could be material. Changes in accounting assumptions, judgments or estimates, or the application of certain accounting principles, could result in significant losses or other adverse impacts on Citi’s financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nFor additional information about Citi’s management of cybersecurity risk, see “Managing Global Risk—Operational Risk—Cybersecurity Risk” below.\\n---\\nspecifics and timing of such outcomes. For example, many reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or models used by Citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not hold in times of market stress, limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances. If Citi’s assumptions, judgments or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual or subsequent events, Citi could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant. Citi could also experience declines in its stock price, be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and incur fines and other losses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 16. For example, the CECL methodology requires that Citi provide reserves for a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for its loan portfolios and other financial assets, as applicable, at the time those assets are originated or acquired. This estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. Citi’s ACL estimate depends upon its CECL models and assumptions; forecasted macroeconomic conditions, including, among other things, the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (real GDP); and the credit indicators, composition and other characteristics of Citi’s loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets. These model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time, resulting in variability in Citi’s ACL and, thus, impact its results of operations and financial condition, as well as regulatory capital due to the CECL phase-in (see the capital return risk factor above).\\n\\nMoreover, Citi has incurred losses related to its foreign operations that are reported in the CTA components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations, such as those related to Citi’s remaining divestitures or legacy businesses, would result in reclassification of any foreign CTA component of AOCI related to that foreign operation, including related hedges and taxes, into Citi’s earnings. For example, Citi could incur a significant loss on sale due to CTA losses related to any signing of a sale agreement for its remaining consumer banking divestitures (see the capital return and continued investments risk factors above). The majority of these losses would be regulatory capital neutral at closing. For additional information on Citi’s accounting policy for foreign currency translation and its foreign CTA components of AOCI, see Notes 1 and 21.\\n\\nChanges to Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact on How Citi Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Periodically, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issues financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of Citi’s financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, including those areas where Citi is required to make assumptions or estimates. Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB, the SEC, U.S. banking regulators or others, could present operational challenges and could also require Citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. See Note 1 for additional information on Citi’s accounting policies and changes in accounting, including the expected impacts on Citi’s results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nIf Citi’s Risk Management and Other Processes, Strategies or Models Are Deficient or Ineffective, Citi May Incur Significant Losses and Its Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios Could Be Negatively Impacted. Citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and other processes and strategies, including the use of models in analyzing and monitoring the various risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For example, Citi uses models as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives across the Company. Citi also relies on data to aggregate, assess and manage various risk exposures. Management of these risks and the reliability of the data are made more challenging within a large, global financial institution, such as Citi, particularly due to complex, diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which Citi operates. Unexpected losses can result from untimely, inaccurate or incomplete processes and data. As discussed below, in October 2020, Citigroup and Citibank entered into consent orders with the FRB and OCC that require Citigroup and Citibank to make improvements in various aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance, and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above and the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below).\\n\\nCiti’s risk management and other processes, strategies and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in many circumstances, assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, particularly given various macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges and uncertainties (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor above), nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. For example, many models used by Citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not necessarily hold in times of market stress, limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances, or identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data. Citi could incur significant losses, receive negative regulatory evaluation or examination findings or be subject to additional enforcement actions, and its regulatory capital, capital ratios and ability to return capital could be negatively impacted, if Citi’s risk management and other processes, including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or models are deficient or ineffective. For additional information, see the capital return risk factor above and the heightened regulatory\\n---\\n## scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk\\n\\nFor example, the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in the first half of 2023 resulted in market volatility across the financial sector.\\n\\nMoreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, including its credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. Citi is required to notify and obtain preapproval from both the OCC and FRB prior to implementing certain risk-weighted asset treatments, as well as certain model changes, resulting in a more challenging environment within which Citi must operate in managing its risk-weighted assets. Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking regulators regarding the U.S. regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, including, but not limited to, potential revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules, known as the Basel III Endgame (for information about the Basel III Endgame, see the capital return risk factor and “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” above), have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk-weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s capital ratios and its ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements.\\n\\n## CREDIT RISKS\\n\\nCredit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.\\n\\nCiti has credit exposures to consumer, corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the U.S. and various countries and jurisdictions globally, including end-of-period consumer loans of $389 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $300 billion at December 31, 2023. For additional information on Citi’s corporate and consumer loan portfolios, see “Managing Global Risk—Corporate Credit” and “—Consumer Credit” below.\\n\\nA default by or a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of a borrower or other counterparty, or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral, exposes Citi to credit risk. Despite Citi’s target client strategy, various macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other factors, among other things, can increase Citi’s credit risk and credit costs, particularly for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties and co-branding and private label credit card risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below). For example, a weakening of economic conditions can adversely affect borrowers’ ability to repay their obligations, as well as result in Citi being unable to liquidate the collateral it holds or forced to liquidate the collateral at prices that do not cover the full amount owed to Citi. Citi is also a member of various central clearing counterparties and could incur financial losses as a result of defaults by other clearing members due to the requirements of clearing members to share losses. Additionally, due to the interconnectedness among financial institutions, concerns about the creditworthiness of or defaults by a financial institution could spread to other financial market participants and result in market-wide losses and disruption.\\n\\n## LIQUIDITY RISKS\\n\\nCiti’s Businesses, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted if It Does Not Effectively Manage Its Liquidity.\\n\\nAs a large, global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets (e.g., the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in the first half of 2023); changes in fiscal and monetary policies and regulatory requirements; negative investor perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements; credit ratings; and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources.\\n---\\n## In addition, Citi competes with other banks and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer deposits, which represent Citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding. The competition for deposits has continued to increase, including as a result of quantitative tightening by central banks, the current higher interest rate environment and fixed income alternatives for customer funds.\\n\\nFurther, Citi’s costs to obtain and access wholesale funding are directly related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and its credit spreads. Changes in Citi’s credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or Citi’s financial prospects, and can be highly volatile. For additional information on Citi’s primary sources of funding, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.\\n\\nCiti’s ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could also increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or to a greater extent than expected, or if market appetite for corporate debt securities declines, as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis. Citi’s ability to sell assets may also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or a liquid market does not exist for such assets. Additionally, unexpected changes in client needs due to idiosyncratic events or market conditions could result in greater than expected drawdowns from off-balance sheet committed facilities. A sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or protracted dislocation of capital markets activity.\\n\\nIn addition, clearing organizations, central banks, clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may exercise the right to require additional collateral during challenging market conditions, which could further impair Citi’s liquidity. If Citi fails to effectively manage its liquidity, its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nLimitations on the payments that Citigroup Inc. receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity. As a holding company, Citigroup Inc. relies on interest, dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements entered into in connection with Citigroup Inc.’s resolution plan. Citigroup Inc.’s broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses.\\n\\nA bank holding company is also required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, the FRB may require Citigroup Inc. to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Citigroup Inc. or its shareholders or creditors, reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations.\\n\\n## COMPLIANCE RISKS\\n\\nSignificantly Heightened Regulatory Expectations and Scrutiny in the U.S. and Globally and Ongoing Interpretation and Implementation of Regulatory and Legislative Requirements and Changes Have Increased Citi’s Compliance, Regulatory and Other Risks and Costs. Large financial institutions, such as Citi, face significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally, including with respect to, among other things, governance, infrastructure, data and risk management practices and controls. These regulatory expectations extend to their employees and agents and also include, among other things, those related to customer and client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering, increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes and various regulatory requirements.\\n---\\nreporting requirements. U.S. financial institutions also face Dividends, Changes to Directors and/or Officers and increased expectations and scrutiny in the wake of the failures of several regional banks and other banking stresses in the first half of 2023. In addition, Citi is continually required to interpret and implement extensive and frequently changing regulatory and legislative requirements in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which it does business, which may overlap or conflict across jurisdictions, resulting in substantial compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs.\\n\\nA failure to comply with these expectations and requirements, even if inadvertent, or resolve any identified deficiencies in a timely and sufficiently satisfactory manner to regulators, could result in increased regulatory oversight; material restrictions, including, among others, imposition of additional capital buffers and limitations on capital distributions; enforcement proceedings; penalties; and fines (see the capital return risk factor above and legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below).\\n\\nOver the past several years, Citi has been required to implement a large number of regulatory and legislative changes, including new regulatory or legislative requirements or regimes, across its businesses and functions, and these changes continue. The changes themselves may be complex and subject to interpretation, and result in changes to Citi’s businesses. In addition, the changes require continued substantial technology and other investments. In some cases, Citi’s implementation of a regulatory or legislative requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance from multiple jurisdictions (including various U.S. states) and regulators, legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules.\\n\\nExamples of regulatory or legislative changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include (i) the U.S. regulatory capital framework and requirements, which have continued to evolve (see the capital return risk factor and “Capital Resources” above); (ii) various laws relating to the limitation of cross-border data movement and/or collection and use of customer information, including data localization and protection and privacy laws, which also can conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect to other laws, including anti-money laundering laws; and (iii) the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which may overlap but also diverge from climate-related disclosure requirements expected to come into effect in other jurisdictions, including in the U.S.\\n\\nIn addition, certain U.S. regulatory agencies and states and non-U.S. authorities have prioritized issues of social, economic and racial justice, and are in the process of considering ways in which these issues can be mitigated, including through rulemaking, supervision and other means, even while certain U.S. state and other governments are pursuing and signaling challenges that may conflict with corporate ESG initiatives.\\n\\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Proceedings, Examinations, Investigations, Consent Orders and Related Compliance Efforts and Other Inquiries That Could Result in Large Monetary Penalties, Supervisory or Enforcement Orders, Business Restrictions, Limitations on Dividends, Changes to Directors and/or Officers and Collateral Consequences Arising from Such Outcomes. At any given time, Citi is a party to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations. Additionally, Citi remains subject to governmental and regulatory investigations, consent orders (see discussion below) and related compliance efforts, and other inquiries. Citi could also be subject to enforcement proceedings and negative regulatory evaluation or examination findings not only because of violations of laws and regulations, but also due to failures, as determined by its regulators, to have adequate policies and procedures, or to remedy deficiencies on a timely basis (see also the capital return and resolution plan risk factors above). Citi’s regulators have broad powers and discretion under their prudential and supervisory authority, and have pursued active inspection and investigatory oversight.\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, the October 2020 FRB and OCC consent orders require Citigroup and Citibank to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance, and internal controls. These improvements will result in continued significant investments by Citi during 2024 and beyond, as an essential part of Citi’s broader transformation efforts to enhance its risk, controls, data and finance infrastructure and compliance. There can be no assurance that such improvements will be implemented in a manner satisfactory, in both timing and sufficiency, to the FRB and OCC.\\n\\nAlthough there are no restrictions on Citi’s ability to serve its clients, the OCC consent order requires Citibank to obtain prior approval of any significant new acquisition, including any portfolio or business acquisition, excluding ordinary course transactions. Moreover, the OCC consent order provides that the OCC has the right to assess future civil money penalties or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions. Such actions by the OCC could include imposing business restrictions, including possible limitations on the declaration or payment of dividends and changes in directors and/or senior executive officers. More generally, the OCC and/or the FRB could take additional enforcement or other actions if the regulatory agency believes that Citi has not met regulatory expectations regarding compliance with the consent orders. For additional information regarding the consent orders, see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above.\\n\\nThe global judicial, regulatory and political environment has generally been challenging for large financial institutions, which have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. The complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of Citi’s operations, also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and authorities in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in foreign jurisdictions, as well as multiple civil litigation claims in multiple jurisdictions. Violations of law by other financial institutions may also result in regulatory scrutiny of Citi. Responding to regulatory\\n---\\ninquiries and proceedings can be time consuming and costly, and divert management attention from Citi’s businesses.\\n\\n## OTHER RISKS\\n\\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused on the culture of financial services firms, including Citi, as well as “conduct risk,” a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third parties, that could harm clients, customers, employees or the integrity of the markets, such as improperly creating, selling, marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive compensation programs with respect thereto, failures to safeguard a party’s personal information, or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest.\\n\\nIn addition to the greater focus on conduct risk, the general heightened scrutiny and expectations from regulators could lead to investigations and other inquiries, as well as remediation requirements, regulatory restrictions, structural changes, more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings, civil litigation and higher compliance and other risks and costs. For additional information, see the capital return and heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factors above. Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients, customers, employees or the integrity of the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented.\\n\\nMoreover, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which Citi is subject has remained elevated. For example, U.S. and certain non-U.S. governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from, financial institutions and individual employees. These types of actions by U.S. and other governments may, in the future, have significant collateral consequences for Citi, including loss of customers and business, operational loss, and the inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies, consent orders, sanctions, substantial fines and penalties, remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future, including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of which could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, business practices, financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi’s operations or cause Citi substantial reputational harm.\\n\\nAdditionally, many large claims—both private civil and regulatory—asserted against Citi are highly complex, slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, these accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued (see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above). In addition, certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved. For further information on Citi’s legal and regulatory proceedings, see Note 30.\\n\\nDuring 2023, emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately 40% of Citi’s total revenues (Citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in Latin America, Asia (other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand), and central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Citi’s presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks.\\n\\nEmerging market risks include, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility, including devaluations and strength in the U.S. dollar; sustained elevated interest rates and quantitative tightening; elevated inflation and hyperinflation; foreign exchange controls, including an inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; macroeconomic, geopolitical and domestic political challenges, uncertainties and volatility, including with respect to Russia (see the macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factor above and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “—Ukraine” below); cyberattacks; restrictions arising from retaliatory laws and regulations; sanctions or asset freezes; sovereign debt volatility; fluctuations in commodity prices; election outcomes; regulatory changes, including potential conflicts among regulations with other jurisdictions where Citi does business; limitations on foreign investment; sociopolitical instability; civil unrest; crime, corruption and fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; potential criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; and confiscation of assets; and these risks can be exacerbated in the event of a deterioration in the relationship between the U.S. and an emerging market country.\\n\\nFor example, Citi operates in several countries that have, or have had in the past, strict capital controls, currency controls and/or sanctions, such as Argentina and Russia, that limit its ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and/or transfer funds outside of those countries. For instance, Citi may need to record additional translation losses due to currency controls in Argentina (see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” below). Moreover, Citi may need to record additional reserves for expected losses for its credit exposures based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law (see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” and “—Russia” and “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below).\\n\\nIn addition, political turmoil and instability; geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts (including those related to Russia’s war in Ukraine as well as a persistent and/or escalating conflict in the Middle East); terrorism; and other instabilities have occurred in various regions and emerging market countries across the globe, which impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial conditions in affected countries and have required, and may continue to require, management time and attention and other resources, such as managing the impact of sanctions and their effect on Citi’s operations in certain emerging market countries.\\n---\\n## CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThis section summarizes Citi’s Operational Footprint goals and Net Zero commitment.\\n\\nCiti’s annual ESG Report provides information on a broad set of ESG-related efforts. The upcoming Citi Climate Report, formerly named the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, provides information on Citi’s continued progress to manage climate risk and its Net Zero plan, including information on financed emissions and 2030 interim emissions reduction targets.\\n\\nFor information regarding Citi’s management of climate risk, see “Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—Climate Risk” below.\\n\\n### ESG and Climate-Related Governance\\n\\nCiti’s Board of Directors (Board) provides oversight of Citi’s management activities (see “Managing Global Risk—Risk Governance” below).\\n\\n- The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board provides oversight and receives updates on Citi’s environmental and social policies and commitments.\\n- The Risk Management Committee of the Board provides oversight of Citi’s Risk Management Framework and risk culture and reviews Citi’s key risk policies and frameworks, including receiving climate risk-related updates.\\n- The Audit Committee of the Board provides oversight of controls and procedures pertaining to the ESG-related metrics and related disclosures in Citi’s SEC filed reports and group-level voluntary ESG reporting, as well as management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures for group-level ESG reporting.\\n\\nAdditionally, Citi’s ESG Council consists of senior members of the management team and certain subject matter experts who provide oversight of Citi’s ESG goals and activities.\\n\\n### Sustainable Finance\\n\\nCiti’s Sustainable Finance Goal, as previously disclosed, supports a combination of environmental and social finance activities. Delivering on the sustainable finance goal is an integrated effort across the organization with products and service offerings across multiple lines of business.\\n\\n### Operational Footprint Goals\\n\\nCiti measures progress against operational footprint goals, which include efforts to reduce the environmental impact of its facilities through reductions in emissions, energy, water consumption, and waste generation. Citi’s efforts to integrate sustainable practices include sustainable building certifications, renewable electricity sourcing, employee engagement, and seeking opportunities for efficiency in business travel. In 2023, Citi made progress toward these goals by increasing on-site solar generation, promoting initiatives on waste diversion and recycling, mapping weather.\\n---\\nrelated risk at its facilities and employing carbon-reduction techniques for building renovations.\\n\\nAdditional Information\\n\\nFor additional information on Citi’s environmental and social policies and priorities, click on “Our Impact” on Citi’s website at www.citigroup.com.

Citi seeks to enhance the competitive strength of its workforce through the following efforts:\\n\\n- Continuously innovating its efforts to recruit, train, develop, compensate, promote and engage colleagues\\n- Actively seeking and listening to diverse perspectives at all levels of the organization\\n- Optimizing transparency concerning workforce goals to promote accountability, credibility and effectiveness in achieving those goals\\n- Providing compensation programs that are competitive in the market and aligned to strategic objectives\\n\\nThe following table presents the geographic distribution of Citi’s colleagues by segment or component and gender:\\n\\n|Segment or component|(in thousands)|North America|International|Total|Women|Men|Unspecified|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Services| | | |4|20|24|52.4 %|47.6 %|— %|\\n|Markets| | | |3|7|10|38.9|61.1|—|\\n|Banking| | | |3|6|9|43.2|56.8|0.01|\\n|USPB| | | |21|—|21|65.3|34.7|—|\\n|Wealth| | | |6|8|14|49.9|50.1|—|\\n|All Other, including Legacy Franchises, Operations and Technology, and Global Staff Functions| | | |54|107|161|47.8|52.2|—|\\n|Total| | | |91|148|239|49.4 %|50.6 %|0.01 %|\\n\\n(1) Colleague distribution is based on assigned region, which may not reflect where the colleague physically resides.\\n\\n(2) Mexico is included in International.\\n\\n(3) Part-time colleagues represented less than 0.9% of Citi’s global workforce.\\n\\n(4) Information regarding gender is self-identified by colleagues.\\n\\n63\\n---\\n## Driving a Culture of Excellence and Accountability\\n\\nCiti continues to embark on a talent and culture transformation to drive a culture of excellence and accountability that is supported by strong risk and controls management. Citi\\'s Leadership Principles of \"taking ownership, delivering with pride and succeeding together\" have been reinforced through a behavioral science-led campaign, referred to as Citi\\'s New Way, that reinforces the key working habits that support Citi\\'s leadership culture.\\n\\nCiti also raised its U.S. minimum wage in 2022, the second broad-based increase in less than two years.\\n\\n### Citi\\'s Performance Management Approach\\n\\nCiti\\'s performance management approach emphasizes the Leadership Principles through a four-pillar system, evaluating colleagues against financial performance, risk and controls, and client and franchise goals as well as how colleagues deliver from a leadership perspective. The performance management and incentive compensation processes and associated policies and frameworks have enhanced accountability through increased rigor and consistency, in particular for risk and controls.\\n\\n### Pay Equity\\n\\nCiti has focused on measuring and addressing pay equity within the organization:\\n\\n- In 2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial institution to publicly release the results of a pay equity review comparing its compensation of women to that of men, as well as U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities.\\n- Since 2018, Citi has continued to be transparent about pay equity, including disclosing its unadjusted or \"raw\" pay gap for both women and U.S. minorities.\\n- Citi\\'s 2022 raw pay gap analysis showed that the median pay for women globally was 78% of the median for men, up from 74% in 2021 and 2020.\\n- The median pay for U.S. minorities was more than 97% of the median for non-minorities, which was up from just above 96% in 2021 and 94% in 2020.\\n\\n### Workforce Development\\n\\nCiti\\'s numerous programmatic offerings aim to reinforce its culture and values, foster understanding of compliance requirements, and develop competencies required to deliver excellence to its clients.

Accordingly, Citi has established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to ensure that all of Citi’s risks are managed appropriately and consistently across the Company and at an aggregate, enterprise-wide level. Citi’s culture drives a strong risk and control environment, and is at the heart of the ERM Framework, underpinning the way Citi conducts business. The activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition (see below) and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. As discussed above, Citi also continues its efforts to comply with the FRB and OCC consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance, and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” above).\\n\\nUnder Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, which was developed by its senior leadership and distributed throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all colleagues to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in Citi’s clients’ best interests, create economic value and are always systemically responsible.\\n\\nAs discussed in “Human Capital Resources and Management” above, Citi has designed Leadership Principles that represent the qualities, behaviors and expectations all employees must exhibit to deliver on Citi’s mission of enabling growth and economic progress. The Leadership Principles inform Citi’s ERM Framework and contribute to creating a culture that drives client, control and operational excellence. Citi colleagues share a common responsibility to uphold these Leadership Principles and hold themselves to the highest standards of ethics and professional behavior in dealing with Citi’s clients, business colleagues, shareholders, communities and each other.\\n\\nCiti’s ERM Framework details the principles used to support effective enterprise-wide risk management across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The ERM Framework covers the risk management roles and responsibilities of the Citigroup Board of Directors (the Board), Citi’s Executive Management Team (see “Risk Governance—Executive Management Team” below) and employees across the lines of defense. The underlying pillars of the framework encompass:\\n\\n- Culture—the core principles and behaviors that underpin a strong culture of risk awareness, in line with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, and Leadership Principles;\\n- Governance—the committee structure and reporting arrangements that support the appropriate oversight of risk management activities at the Board and Executive Management Team levels and establishes Citi’s Lines of Defense model;\\n- Risk Management—the end-to-end risk management cycle including the identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks including top, material, growing, idiosyncratic and emerging risks, and aggregated to an enterprise-wide level; and\\n- Enterprise Programs—the key risk management programs performed across the risk management lifecycle for all risk categories.\\n\\nEach of these pillars is underpinned by supporting capabilities covering people, infrastructure and tools that are in place to enable the execution of the ERM Framework.\\n\\nCiti’s approach to risk management requires that its risk-taking be consistent with its risk appetite. Risk appetite is the aggregate level of risk that Citi is willing to tolerate in order to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan. Risk limits and thresholds represent allocations of Citi’s risk appetite to businesses and risk categories. Concentration risks are controlled through a subset of these limits and thresholds.\\n\\nCiti’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows:\\n\\n- Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality (or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations.\\n- Liquidity risk is the risk that Citi will not be able to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of Citi. Risk may be exacerbated by the inability of the Company to access funding sources or monetize assets and the composition of liability funding and liquid assets.\\n- Market risk (Trading and Non-Trading): Market risk of trading portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables, such as interest rates, equity and commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or credit spreads. Market risk of non-trading portfolios is the impact of adverse changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and equity prices on Citi’s net interest income, economic value of equity, or AOCI.\\n- Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, settlements and regulatory fines) resulting from Citi’s failure to comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical standards or contractual obligations.\\n- Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards.\\n- Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial conditions and resilience from negative opinion held by\\n\\n68\\n---\\n## stakeholders. This risk may impair Citi’s competitiveness\\n\\nby affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or continue servicing existing relationships.\\n\\n## Second Line of Defense: Independent Risk Management\\n\\nIndependent risk management units are independent of the first line of defense. They are responsible for overseeing the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense and challenging the first line of defense in the execution of its risk management responsibilities. They are also responsible for independently identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting aggregate risks and for setting standards for the management and oversight of risk. Independent risk management is composed of Independent Risk Management (IRM) and Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM), which are led by the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Group Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) who have unrestricted access to the Board and its Risk Management Committee to facilitate the ability to execute their specific responsibilities pertaining to escalation to the Board.\\n\\n## Independent Risk Management\\n\\nThe IRM organization sets risk and control standards for the first line of defense and actively manages and oversees aggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity, strategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi, including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk, country risk and climate risk.\\n\\nIRM is organized to align to risk categories, legal entities/regions and Company-wide, cross-risk functions or processes. Each of these units reports to a member of the Risk Management Executive Council, who are all direct reports to the Citigroup CRO.\\n\\n## Independent Compliance Risk Management\\n\\nThe ICRM organization actively oversees compliance risk across Citi, sets compliance standards for the first line of defense to manage compliance risk and promotes business conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition and the compliance risk appetite. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide compliance risk management framework and culture that identifies, measures, monitors, controls and escalates compliance risk across Citi.\\n\\nICRM is aligned by product line, function and geography to provide compliance risk management advice and credible challenge on day-to-day matters and strategic decision-making for key initiatives. ICRM also has program-level Enterprise Compliance units responsible for setting standards and establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts. The CCO reports to Citi’s General Counsel and ICRM is organizationally part of the Global Legal Affairs & Compliance group. In addition, the CCO has matrix reporting into the CRO and is part of the Risk Management Executive Council.\\n\\n## Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit\\n\\nInternal Audit is independent of the first line, second line and enterprise support functions. The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and timely assurance to the Board, its Audit Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls that mitigate current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture within Citi. The Citi Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit\\n---\\n### and reports functionally to the Chair of the Citi Audit\\n\\ncapital management, and (ii) oversight of the Global Risk Committee and administratively to the Citi Chief Executive Officer. The Citi Chief Auditor has unrestricted access to the Board and the Board Audit Committee to address risks and issues identified through Internal Audit’s activities.\\n\\n## Enterprise Support Functions\\n\\nEnterprise support functions engage in activities that support safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in maintaining an effective control environment.\\n\\nEnterprise support functions are composed of Human Resources and Global Legal Affairs and Compliance (exclusive of ICRM, which is part of the second line of defense). Front line units may also include enterprise support units and/or conduct enterprise support activities (e.g., the Controllers Group within Finance).\\n\\nEnterprise support functions, units and activities are subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight processes specific to the risks for which they are accountable (e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).\\n\\n## Risk Governance\\n\\nCiti’s ERM Framework encompasses risk management processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi’s commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk management practices.\\n\\n## Board Oversight\\n\\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of Citi and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for implementing the ERM Framework and meeting strategic objectives within Citi’s risk appetite.\\n\\n## Executive Management Team\\n\\nThe Citigroup CEO directs and oversees the day-to-day management of Citi as delegated by the Board of Directors. The CEO leads the Company through the Executive Management Team and provides oversight of group activities, both directly and through authority delegated to committees established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure continued alignment with Citi’s risk strategy.\\n\\n## Board and Executive Management Committees\\n\\nThe Board executes its responsibilities either directly or through its committees. The Board has delegated authority to the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its oversight and risk management responsibilities:\\n\\nRisk Management Committee (RMC)\\nassists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility with respect to (i) oversight of Citi’s risk management framework and risk culture, including the significant policies and practices used in managing credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance, reputation and certain other risks, including those pertaining to\\n\\n## Committees\\n\\n• Audit Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s financial and regulatory reporting and internal control risk, as well as Internal Audit and Citi’s external independent accountants.\\n\\n• Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee: provides oversight of compensation of Citi’s employees and Citi management’s sustained focus on fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible conduct and accountability within the organization.\\n\\n• Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee: responsible for (i) identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending to the Board the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) leading the Board in its annual review of the Board’s performance, (iii) recommending to the Board directors for each committee for appointment by the Board, (iv) reviewing the Company’s policies and programs that relate to public issues of significance to the Company and the public at large, including but not limited to Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) matters and (v) reviewing the Company’s relationships with external constituencies and issues that impact the Company’s reputation, and advising management as to its approach to each.\\n\\n• Technology Committee: assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility with respect to oversight of (i) the planning and execution of Citigroup’s technology, strategy and operating plan, (ii) the development of Citi’s target state operating model and architecture, including the incorporation of Global Business Services, (iii) technology-based risk management, including risk management framework, risk appetite and risk exposures of the Company, (iv) resource and talent planning of the Technology function and (v) the Company’s third-party management policies, practices and standards that relate to Technology.\\n\\n• Transformation Oversight Committee: provides oversight of the actions of Citi’s management to develop and execute a transformation of Citi’s risk and control environment pursuant to the FRB and OCC consent orders.\\n\\n## Standing Committees\\n\\nThe Citigroup CEO has established four standing committees that cover the primary risks to which Citi (i.e., Group) is exposed. These consist of:\\n\\n• Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC): the primary senior executive level committee responsible for (i) overseeing the execution of Citigroup’s ERM Framework, (ii) monitoring Citi’s risk profile at an aggregate level inclusive of individual risk categories, (iii) ensuring that Citi’s risk profile remains consistent with its approved risk appetite and (iv) discussing material and emerging risk issues facing the Company. The Committee also provides comprehensive Group-wide coverage of all\\n---\\n## Risk Categories:\\n\\nincluding Credit Risk, Market Risk (trading) and Strategic Risk.\\n\\n## Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO):\\n\\nresponsible for governance over management’s Liquidity Risk and Market Risk (non-trading) management and for monitoring and influencing the balance sheet, investment securities and capital management activities of Citigroup.\\n\\n## Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC):\\n\\nprovides governance oversight of Citi’s Compliance and Operational Risks.\\n\\n## Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC):\\n\\nprovides governance oversight for Reputation Risk management across Citi.\\n\\nIn addition to the Executive Management committees listed above, management may establish ad-hoc committees in response to regulatory feedback or to manage additional activities when deemed necessary.\\n\\n|Board Committees|Risk Management Committee|Audit Committee|Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee|Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee|Technology Committee|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Group Executive Management Committees|Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC)|Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO)|Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC)|Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC)| |\\n\\nThe figure below illustrates the reporting lines between the Board and Executive Management committees:\\n\\nCitigroup Board\\n---\\n## CREDIT RISK\\n\\n### Loans\\n\\nThe table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:\\n\\n|In billions of dollars|4Q23|3Q23|4Q22|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Services|$83|$83|$78|\\n|Markets|115|108|111|\\n|Banking|87|87|96|\\n|USPB| | | |\\n|Branded Cards|$107|$103|$95|\\n|Retail Services|52|50|48|\\n|Retail Banking|43|43|37|\\n|Total USPB|$202|$196|$180|\\n|Wealth|$150|$151|$150|\\n|All Other (1)|$38|$37|$38|\\n|Total Citigroup loans (AVG)|$675|$662|$653|\\n|Total Citigroup loans (EOP)|$689|$666|$657|\\n\\n(1) See footnote 2 to the table in “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit—Consumer Credit Portfolio” below.\\n\\nEnd-of-period loans increased 5% year-over-year, largely reflecting growth in cards in USPB. End-of-period loans increased 3% sequentially.\\n\\nOn an average basis, loans increased 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely due to growth in USPB, Services and Markets, partially offset by a decline in Banking.\\n\\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2023, average loans for:\\n\\n- USPB increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in Branded Cards, Retail Banking, and Retail Services.\\n- Wealth were largely unchanged.\\n- Services increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS in North America and internationally.\\n- Markets increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting increased client demand in warehouse lending.\\n- Banking decreased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by capital optimization efforts.\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality of a client, customer, or counterparty (or downgrade risk) or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party, or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations. Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as an institution (see “Risk Factors—Credit Risks” above). Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business activities, including:\\n\\n- consumer, commercial, and corporate lending;\\n- capital markets derivative transactions;\\n- structured finance; and\\n- securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities loaned and borrowed).\\n\\nCredit risk also arises from clearing and settlement activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a specific client, industry, region, or other category.\\n\\nCiti has an established framework in place for managing credit risk across all businesses that includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits, and credit policies. Citi’s credit risk management framework also includes policies and procedures to manage problem exposures.\\n\\nTo manage concentration risk, Citi has in place a framework consisting of industry limits, single-name concentrations for each business and across Citigroup, and a specialized product limit framework.\\n\\nCredit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as well as other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed to Citi by a given counterparty.\\n\\nThe credit risk associated with Citi’s credit exposures is a function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its allowance for credit losses (ACL) process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 and 16), as well as through regular stress testing at the company, business, geography, and product levels. These stress-testing processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties. See Note 15 for additional information on Citi’s credit risk management.\\n---\\n## CORPORATE CREDIT\\n\\nConsistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are typically corporations that value the depth and breadth of Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with these clients whose needs encompass multiple products, including cash management and trade services, foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory.\\n\\n### Corporate Credit Portfolio\\n\\nThe following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio within Services, Markets, Banking and the Mexico SBMM component of All Other—Legacy Franchises (excluding loans carried at fair value and loans held-for-sale), and before consideration of collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods indicated:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|September 30, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Greater than 1 year|Greater than 1 year|Greater than 1 year|\\n| |Due within 1 year|but within 5 years|Greater than 5 years|Total exposure|Due within 1 year|but within 5 years|Greater than 5 years|Total exposure|Due within 1 year|but within 5 years|Greater than 5 years|Total exposure|\\n|In billions of dollars|$ 132|$ 122|$ 39|$ 293|$ 125|$ 118|$ 38|$ 281|$ 135|$ 122|$ 27|$ 284|\\n|Direct outstandings (on-balance sheet)| | | |\\n|Unfunded lending commitments (off-balance sheet)|$ 134|$ 268|$ 18|$ 420|$ 144|$ 259|$ 19|$ 422|$ 140|$ 256|$ 10|$ 406|\\n|Total exposure|$ 266|$ 390|$ 57|$ 713|$ 269|$ 377|$ 57|$ 703|$ 275|$ 378|$ 37|$ 690|\\n\\n(1) Includes drawn loans, overdrafts, bankers’ acceptances and leases.\\n\\n(2) Includes unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial guarantees.\\n\\n### Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty\\n\\nCiti’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage of this portfolio by region based on Citi’s internal management geography:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|September 30, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |AAA/AA/A|BBB|BB/B|CCC or below|Total|\\n|North America|56%|56%|56%|\\n|International|44%|44%|44%|\\n|Total|100%|100%|100%|\\n\\nThe maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.\\n\\nRisk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment.\\n---\\n## Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be Portfolio Mix—Industry\\n\\nappropriately rated and classified as of December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, Branded Cards represented 67% of total U.S. cards EOP loans and Retail Services represented 33% of U.S. cards EOP loans.\\n\\n| |Retail Services|\\n|---|---|\\n| |5.44%|\\n| |4.08%|\\n| |4.46%|\\n| |4.53%|\\n| |3.30%|\\n| |2.10%|\\n| |2.31%|\\n| |2.60%|\\n| |2.71%|\\n| |1.56%|\\n| |1.76%|\\n| |1.77%|\\n| |2.12%|\\n| |2.36%|\\n| |1.05%|\\n| |1.15%|\\n| |1.16%|\\n| |1.35%|\\n| |4021|\\n| |1022|\\n| |20*22|\\n| |30*22|\\n| |40*22|\\n| |10*23|\\n| |20*23|\\n| |30*23|\\n| |40*23|\\n\\nUSPB’s Retail Services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail Services’ target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics, and fuel. Retail Services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, lending, or payment programs and growth potential.\\n\\nFor additional information on the cost of credit, loan delinquency, and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations above and Note 15.\\n---\\n## Retail Banking\\n\\n| |1.54%| | | | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|0.62%|0.56%|0.70%|0.47%|0.66%|0.59%|0.59%|0.62%| |\\n|0.44%| |0.52%|0.51%|0.53%|0.42%|0.39%|0.38%|0.40%|\\n\\nUSPB’s Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 15.\\n\\nAs presented in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Retail Banking for the fourth quarter of 2023 was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth and seasoning of personal loans.\\n\\nThe 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages.\\n\\n## Mexico Consumer\\n\\n| |3.97%|3.78%|3.82%|3.87%|3.65%|4.12%|4.35%|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |3.12%|3.30%| | | | |\\n| |1.38%|1.32%|1.29%|1.26%|1.28%|1.24%|1.37%|1.32%|1.35%|\\n\\nMexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers.\\n\\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of loss rates from post-pandemic lows. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\\n\\n## Wealth\\n\\n| |0.31%|0.32%|0.27%|0.28%|0.19%|0.21%|0.16%|0.18%|0.18%|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|0.04%| |0.03%|0.05%|0.04%|0.15%|0.05%|0.06%|0.06%|0.08%|\\n\\nAs indicated above, Wealth provides consumer mortgages, margin lending, cards and other lending products to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and cards. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $46 billion, or 30%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit.\\n---\\n## U.S. Cards FICO Distribution\\n\\nThe following tables present the current FICO score distributions for Citi’s Branded Cards and Retail Services portfolios based on end-of-period receivables. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio and on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.\\n\\n### Branded Cards\\n\\n|FICO distribution|Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|> 760|46%|46%|48%|\\n|680–760|38|39|38|\\n|< 680|16|15|14|\\n|Total|100%|100%|100%|\\n\\n### Retail Services\\n\\n|FICO distribution|Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|> 760|27%|26%|27%|\\n|680–760|41|42|42|\\n|< 680|32|32|31|\\n|Total|100%|100%|100%|\\n\\n(1) The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer presentations.\\n\\nThe FICO distribution of both card portfolios declined slightly during 2023, primarily reflecting the normalization in net credit loss and delinquency rates. The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality of the portfolios. See Note 15 for additional information on FICO scores.\\n\\n82\\n---\\n## Additional Consumer Credit Details\\n\\n## Consumer Loan Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios\\n\\n|EOP loans|90+ days past due|30–89 days past due|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|December 31, 2021|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|December 31, 2021|\\n| |USPB| | | | | |\\n|Total|$209.1|$2,635|$1,578|$1,069|$2,563|$1,720|$1,130|\\n| |Ratio|1.26%|0.84%|0.64%|1.23%|0.92%|0.68%|\\n|Cards|Total|164.7|2,461|1,415|871|2,293|1,511|947|\\n| |Ratio|1.49%|0.94%|0.65%|1.39%|1.00%|0.71%|\\n| |Branded Cards|111.1|1,194|629|389|1,143|693|408|\\n| |Ratio|1.07%|0.63%|0.44%|1.03%|0.69%|0.46%|\\n| |Retail Services|53.6|1,267|786|482|1,150|818|539|\\n| |Ratio|2.36%|1.56%|1.05%|2.15%|1.62%|1.17%|\\n|Retail Banking|44.4|174|163|198|270|209|183|\\n| |Ratio|0.40%|0.45%|0.62%|0.62%|0.57%|0.57%|\\n|Wealth delinquency-managed loans|$105.3|191|186|281|312|317|323|\\n| |Ratio|0.18%|0.19%|0.31%|0.30%|0.32%|0.35%|\\n|Wealth classifiably managed loans|$46.2|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\\n|All Other|$28.6|407|389|613|384|335|546|\\n| |Ratio|1.43%|1.26%|1.06%|1.35%|1.09%|0.94%|\\n|Mexico Consumer|18.7|252|190|183|252|186|173|\\n| |Ratio|1.35%|1.28%|1.38%|1.35%|1.26%|1.30%|\\n|Asia Consumer|7.4|51|49|209|59|70|285|\\n| |Ratio|0.69%|0.37%|0.51%|0.80%|0.53%|0.69%|\\n|Legacy Holdings Assets (consumer)|2.5|104|150|221|73|79|88|\\n| |Ratio|4.52%|5.56%|6.31%|3.17%|2.93%|2.51%|\\n|Total Citigroup consumer|$389.2|3,233|2,153|1,963|3,259|2,372|1,999|\\n| |Ratio|0.94%|0.68%|0.62%|0.95%|0.75%|0.63%|\\n\\n(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.\\n\\n(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.\\n\\n(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $63 million ($0.5 billion), $89 million ($0.6 billion) and $185 million ($1.1 billion) at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $73 million, $70 million and $74 million at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.\\n\\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail Services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.\\n\\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios.\\n\\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 85%, 96% and 94% of Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.\\n\\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and Russia for all periods presented and in Bahrain for 2021 only.\\n\\n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia Consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and Vietnam closed in 1Q23; Taiwan closed in 3Q23; and Indonesia closed in 4Q23); Australia in 3Q21 (closed in 2Q22); and the Philippines in 4Q21 (closed in 3Q22). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 2.\\n\\n83\\n---\\n## The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios\\n\\nThe 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $67 million ($0.2 billion), $90 million ($0.3 billion) and $138 million ($0.4 billion) at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $36 million, $37 million and $35 million at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The ASU eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. On January 1, 2023, Citi recorded a $352 million decrease in the Allowance for loan losses, along with a $290 million after-tax increase to Retained earnings. See Note 1.\\n\\n(2) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries, and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies.\\n\\n(3) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million.\\n\\n(4) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase accounting adjustments, etc.\\n\\n(5) 2023 includes an approximate $175 million increase related to FX translation.\\n\\n(6) 2022 includes an approximate $350 million reclass related to the announced sales of Citi’s consumer banking businesses in Thailand, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Bahrain and Vietnam.

The following summary provides a general description of each category:\\n\\nCorporate and consumer (including commercial banking) non-accrual status is based on pe determination pat payment of interest or principal is doubtful.\\nA corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still be current on principal and interest payments under pe terms of pe loan structure. Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\\nConsumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, i.e., pe borrower has fallen behind on payments.\\nConsumer mortgage loans, oper pan Federal Housing Administration (FHA)–insured loans, are classified as non-accrual wipin 60 days of notification pat pe borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home equity loans are classified as non-accrual if pe related residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past due.\\nU.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services are not included because, under industry standards, credit card loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual delinquency.\\n---\\n## Non-Accrual Loans\\n\\nThe table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Corporate non-accrual loans by region (1)(2)(3)| | | | | |\\n|North America (4)|$978|$138|$510|$1,486|$1,082|\\n|International|$904|$984|$1,043|$1,560|$942|\\n|Total|$1,882|$1,122|$1,553|$3,046|$2,024|\\n|Corporate non-accrual loans (1)(2)(3)| | | | | |\\n|Banking|$799|$757|$1,166|$2,595|$1,565|\\n|Services|$103|$153|$70|$79|$113|\\n|Markets (4)|$791|$13|$85|$193|$179|\\n|Mexico SBMM|$189|$199|$232|$179|$167|\\n|Total|$1,882|$1,122|$1,553|$3,046|$2,024|\\n|Consumer non-accrual loans (1)| | | | | |\\n|USPB|$291|$282|$344|$456|$269|\\n|Wealth|$288|$259|$336|$494|$174|\\n|Asia Consumer (5)|$22|$30|$209|$296|$267|\\n|Mexico Consumer|$479|$457|$524|$774|$632|\\n|Legacy Holdings Assets (consumer)|$235|$289|$413|$602|$638|\\n|Total|$1,315|$1,317|$1,826|$2,622|$1,980|\\n|Total non-accrual loans|$3,197|$2,439|$3,379|$5,668|$4,004|\\n\\n(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based on a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\n(2) Approximately 50%, 50%, 56%, 64% and 44% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal payments at December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\\n\\n(3) The December 31, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.63% of total corporate loans.\\n\\n(4) The increase at December 31, 2023 was primarily related to two commercial real estate loans.\\n\\n(5) Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all periods presented and in Bahrain for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\\n\\n## Modified Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\\n\\nOn January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs (see Note 1).

The Company holds excess liquidity, primarily in the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as presented in the table below.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nAdequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely outside of Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.\\n\\nCiti’s funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances, including potential Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to resolution planning (see “Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major categories:\\n\\nCitibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank Singapore Lp. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Lp.);\\nCiti’s non-bank and oper entities, including pe parent holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and oper bank and non-bank subsidiaries pat are consolidated into Citigroup (including Citibanamex).\\n\\nAt an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that, in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their designated stress tests.\\n\\nCiti’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and consumer deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.\\n\\nCiti’s funding and liquidity framework, working in concert with overall asset/liability management, helps ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability structure (including funding products) of the Company relative to the liquidity requirements of Citi’s assets. This reduces the\\n\\n## Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement\\n\\n### Stress Testing\\n\\nLiquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position, in order to have sufficient liquidity on hand to manage through such an event. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as Company-specific events.\\n\\nLiquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated on a daily basis.\\n\\nGiven the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses.\\n---\\n## High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)\\n\\n| |Citibank|Citi non-bank and other entities|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|In billions of dollars| | | | | | | | | |\\n|Available cash|$200.6|$203.1|$241.2|$5.6|$5.4|$4.3|$206.2|$208.5|$245.5|\\n|U.S. sovereign|131.6|134.2|130.0|74.3|79.3|68.7|205.9|213.5|198.7|\\n|U.S. agency/agency MBS|51.0|48.5|46.3|3.1|3.6|4.0|54.1|52.1|50.3|\\n|Foreign government debt (1)|76.0|74.3|59.1|18.0|19.9|19.4|94.0|94.2|78.5|\\n|Other investment grade|0.2|0.3|1.7|0.1|0.7|0.5|0.3|1.0|2.2|\\n|Total HQLA (AVG)|$459.4|$460.4|$478.3|$101.1|$108.9|$96.9|$560.5|$569.3|$575.2|\\n\\nNote: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis.

As of December 31, 2023, non-bank included $92.6 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line.\\n\\n(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included.\\n\\n(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded Cards receivables.\\n\\nCiti’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 6% year-over-year, largely driven by issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark debt and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding also increased 4%, largely driven by an increase in customer-related debt at the non-bank entities and increased FHLB borrowings and benchmark senior debt at the bank.\\n\\nAs part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately $32.0 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.\\n---\\n## Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities\\n\\n| |Maturities|2023 Issuances|Maturities 2022|Issuances|Maturities 2021|Issuances|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Non-bank| | | | | | |\\n|Benchmark debt: Senior debt|$10.2|$—|$15.4|$27.3|$17.6|$15.4|\\n|Subordinated debt|$1.3|$3.2|$0.9|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Trust preferred|$—|$—|$0.1|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Customer-related debt|$42.1|$40.1|$27.0|$65.1|$31.2|$48.7|\\n|Local country and other|$3.1|$3.9|$2.8|$3.5|$3.3|$3.6|\\n|Total non-bank|$56.7|$47.2|$46.2|$95.9|$52.1|$67.7|\\n|Bank| | | | | | |\\n|FHLB borrowings|$4.3|$8.5|$5.3|$7.3|$5.7|$—|\\n|Securitizations|$2.4|$1.5|$2.1|$0.2|$6.1|$—|\\n|Citibank benchmark senior debt|$—|$7.5|$0.9|$—|$9.8|$—|\\n|Local country and other|$1.6|$1.1|$2.6|$1.3|$1.2|$2.9|\\n|Total bank|$8.3|$18.6|$10.9|$8.8|$22.8|$2.9|\\n|Total|$65.0|$65.8|$57.1|$104.7|$74.9|$70.6|\\n\\n## Aggregate Long-Term Debt Maturities\\n\\n| |2023|2024|2025|2026|2027|2028|Thereafter|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Non-bank| | | | | | | | |\\n|Benchmark debt: Senior debt|$10.2|$5.5|$12.0|$24.2|$7.1|$15.2|$46.3|$110.3|\\n|Subordinated debt|$1.3|$1.0|$5.0|$2.4|$3.7|$2.0|$10.8|$24.9|\\n|Trust preferred|$—|$—|$—|$—|$—|$—|$1.6|$1.6|\\n|Customer-related debt|$42.1|$26.2|$17.2|$10.0|$9.6|$8.2|$38.9|$110.1|\\n|Local country and other|$3.1|$1.3|$1.8|$0.6|$0.1|$1.0|$3.2|$8.0|\\n|Total non-bank|$56.7|$34.0|$36.0|$37.2|$20.5|$26.4|$100.8|$254.9|\\n|Bank| | | | | | | | |\\n|FHLB borrowings|$4.3|$7.0|$4.5|$—|$—|$—|$—|$11.5|\\n|Securitizations|$2.4|$1.1|$3.1|$—|$0.8|$1.0|$0.7|$6.7|\\n|Citibank benchmark senior debt|$—|$2.6|$2.5|$2.5|$—|$2.5|$—|$10.1|\\n|Local country and other|$1.6|$1.1|$0.3|$0.7|$—|$0.2|$1.1|$3.4|\\n|Total bank|$8.3|$11.8|$10.4|$3.2|$0.8|$3.7|$1.8|$31.7|\\n|Total long-term debt|$65.0|$45.8|$46.4|$40.4|$21.3|$30.1|$102.6|$286.6|\\n---\\n## Resolution Plan\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, in response to feedback received from the FRB and FDIC, Citigroup took the following actions:\\n\\n- Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;\\n- Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities in the event that Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy proceedings (Citi Support Agreement);\\n\\nPursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:\\n\\n- Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, including certain high-quality liquid assets and inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business-as-usual funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;\\n- Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash needs;\\n- In the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will be required to contribute most of its remaining assets to Citicorp;\\n\\nThe obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.\\n\\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\\n\\nU.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure. The intended purpose of the requirements is to facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD amounts and ratios, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards” above.\\n---\\n## SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\\n\\nCiti supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants.\\n\\n### Secured Funding Transactions\\n\\nSecured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions.\\n\\nSecured funding of $269 billion as of December 31, 2023 increased 33% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended December 31, 2023, on an average basis, secured funding was $288 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.\\n\\n### Short-Term Borrowings\\n\\nCiti’s short-term borrowings of $37 billion as of the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 20% year-over-year, reflecting lower commercial paper issuances at the broker-dealer subsidiaries, as Citi continues to diversify its funding profile, and decreased 1% sequentially, driven by normal business activity (see Note 18 for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings).\\n---\\n## CREDIT RATINGS\\n\\nCitigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings.\\n\\nThe table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of December 31, 2023. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody’s Investors Service and A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n### Ratings as of December 31, 2023\\n\\n| |Citigroup Inc.|Citigroup Inc.|Citigroup Inc.|Citibank, N.A.|Citibank, N.A.|Citibank, N.A.|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |Long-term|Short-term|Outlook|Long-term|Short-term|Outlook|\\n|Fitch Ratings (Fitch)|A|F1|Stable|A+|F1|Stable|\\n|Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)|A3|P-2|Stable|Aa3|P-1|Stable|\\n|S&P Global Ratings (S&P)|BBB+|A-2|Stable|A+|A-1|Stable|\\n\\nPotential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.4 billion as of September 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.\\n\\nThe following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.\\n\\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.2 billion, compared to $0.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.\\n---\\n## Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts\\n\\nIn addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $11.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, unchanged from December 31, 2022 (see Note 23).\\n\\nIn addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.\\n---\\n## MARKET RISK\\n\\nAs part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi’s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt, and interest rate derivatives.\\n\\nIn addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.\\n\\nSince the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain assumptions. The changes included, among other things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably accrual positions in the Markets businesses). These changes resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 12-month period.\\n\\n### MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS\\n\\nMarket risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in foreign currencies.\\n\\n### Banking Book Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nFor interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.\\n\\nChanges in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI, and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including:\\n\\n- Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments;\\n- Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;\\n- Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and\\n- Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment.\\n\\n### Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities. Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see “Risk Factors” above.\\n\\nEach business is required to establish, with approval from Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, including various regional, legal entity, and business Risk Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & Liability Committees, and the Citigroup Risk Management and Asset & Liability Committees. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits.\\n---\\n## Limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors\\n\\nthat are aligned with Citi’s risk appetite.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on AOCI\\n\\nCiti also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.\\n\\n### Parallel interest rate shock +100 bps\\n\\n|Interest rate exposure (1)(2)|Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|U.S. dollar|$ (33)|$ 82|$ 186|\\n|All other currencies|$ 1,219|$ 1,214|$ 1,650|\\n|Total|$ 1,186|$ 1,296|$ 1,836|\\n|As a percentage of average interest-earning assets|0.05%|0.06%|0.08%|\\n|Estimated initial negative impact to AOCI (after-tax)|$ (829)|$ (807)|$ (1,102)|\\n|Estimated initial impact on CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario|(12)|(12)|(10)|\\n\\n(1) Excludes trading book and fair value option banking book portfolios and replaces them with the associated transfer pricing.\\n\\n(2) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.\\n\\nThe All other currencies of $1,219 billion as of December 31, 2023 in the table above includes the impact from the following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Korean won, Swiss franc and Chinese yuan. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.\\n\\nCiti’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of December 31, 2023 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to U.S. dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in Citi’s balance sheet. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE.\\n\\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $0.8 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately four months.\\n---\\n## Scenario Analysis\\n\\nThe following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of December 31, 2023. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted|Scenario 1|Scenario 2|Scenario 3|Scenario 4|Scenario 5|Scenario 6|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Overnight rate change (bps)|100|100|—|—|(100)|(100)|\\n|10-year rate change (bps)|100|—|100|(100)|—|(100)|\\n|Interest rate exposure|U.S. dollar|$(33)|$(112)|$109|$(79)|$(343)|$(448)|\\n|All other currencies (1)|1,219|1,039|183|(180)|(936)|(1,104)|\\n|Total|$1,186|$927|$292|$(259)|$(1,279)|$(1,552)|\\n|Estimated initial impact to AOCI (after-tax) (2)|$(829)|$(1,157)|$296|$(592)|$1,147|$538|\\n|Estimated initial impact to CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario|(12)|(10)|(3)|1|10|11|\\n\\nNote: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.\\n\\n(1) Scenario 1 includes the impact from the following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Korean won, Swiss franc and Chinese yuan. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.\\n\\n(2) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.\\n\\nAs presented in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.\\n\\nThe magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.\\n---\\n## Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI\\n\\nThis, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, and Capital. As of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.\\n\\nThis impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.\\n\\nFor the quarter ended\\n\\n| |Dec. 31, 2023|Sept. 30, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Change in FX spot rate (1)|3.2 %|(2.5) %|4.0 %|\\n|Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges|$960|$(1,314)|$1,193|\\n|As a percentage of TCE|0.6 %|(0.8) %|0.8 %|\\n\\nEstimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps):\\n\\n| | | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |1|(1)|(3)|\\n\\n(1) FX spot rate change is a weighted average based on Citi’s quarterly average GAAP capital exposure to foreign countries.\\n---\\n| |Interest Income-Average Rate|Interest Expense-Average Rate|Net Interest Margin|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|8.00%|2021 Net Interest Margin: 1.99%|2022 Net Interest Margin: 2.25%|2023 Net Interest Margin: 2.46%|\\n|7.00%| | |5.82%|6.27%|6.48%|\\n|6.00%| | |5.30%| |4.97%|\\n|5.00%| | |4.62%|4.15%|4.67%|\\n|4.00%| |3.65%|3.59%|\\n|3.00%|2.41%|2.34%|2.35%|2.35%|2.47%|2.92%|2.31%|2.77%|\\n|2.00%|2.02%|1.97%|1.99%|1.98%|2.05%|2.24%| |2.39%|2.41%|2.48%|2.49%|2.46%|\\n|1.00%|0.48%|0.46%|0.45%|0.46%|0.54%|0.85%|1.68%|\\n|0.00%|1021|2021|3021|4021|1022|2022|3022|4022|1023|2023|3023|4023|\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023 vs. 2022|2022 vs. 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Interest income (1)|$ 133,359|$ 74,573|$ 50,667|79%|47%|\\n|Interest expense (2)|$ 78,358|$ 25,740|$ 7,981|204|223|\\n|Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis (1)|$ 55,001|$ 48,833|$ 42,686|13%|14%|\\n|Interest income—average rate (3)|5.97%|3.43%|2.36%|254 bps|107 bps|\\n|Interest expense—average rate|4.35|1.48|0.46|287 bps|102 bps|\\n|Net interest margin (3)(4)|2.46|2.25|1.99|21 bps|26 bps|\\n\\nInterest rate benchmarks\\n\\n| |Two-year U.S. Treasury note—average rate|10-year U.S. Treasury note—average rate|10-year vs. two-year spread|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |4.58%|3.96|(62) bps|\\n| |2.99%|2.95|(4) bps|\\n| |0.27%|1.45|118 bps|\\n\\n(1) Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs of $101 million, $165 million and $192 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n\\n(2) Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the table above.\\n\\n(3) The average rate on interest income and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment.

The increase in Markets net interest income was primarily driven by Fixed Income. The increase in non-Markets primarily reflected higher interest rates and growth in U.S. cards interest-earning balances, partially offset by a reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in All Other—Legacy Franchises. Citi’s net interest margin was 2.46% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of three basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by higher deposit costs, partially offset by higher Markets net interest margin.\\n\\nCiti’s net interest income for 2023 increased 13%, or approximately $6.2 billion, to $54.9 billion ($55.0 billion on a taxable equivalent basis) versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-Markets net interest income, largely reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances in USPB. In 2023, Citi’s net interest margin increased to 2.46% on a taxable equivalent basis, compared to 2.25% in 2022, primarily driven by higher interest rates and a mix-shift in balances.\\n---\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n                                     109\\n---\\n## Additional Interest Rate Details\\n\\n|Average Balances and Interest Rates—Assets|Taxable Equivalent Basis|\\n|---|---|\\n|Average balance|Interest income|% Average rate|\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023|2022|2021|2023|2022|2021|\\n|Assets| | | | | | | | | |\\n|Deposits with banks (4)|$287,518|$262,504|$298,319|$11,238|$4,515|$577|3.91%|1.72%|0.19%|\\n|Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell (5)|$360,855|$353,347|$322,660|$26,887|$7,154|$1,052|7.45%|2.02%|0.33%|\\n|Trading account assets (6)(7)|$332,002|$274,192|$291,937|$14,460|$7,427|$5,371|4.36%|2.71%|1.84%|\\n|Investments|$512,400|$517,722|$488,120|$18,335|$11,276|$7,482|3.58%|2.18%|1.53%|\\n|Consumer loans (8)|$371,896|$355,407|$374,978|$36,864|$28,391|$26,408|9.91%|7.99%|7.04%|\\n|Corporate loans (8)|$289,176|$297,914|$293,058|$21,068|$12,945|$9,124|7.29%|4.35%|3.11%|\\n|Total loans (8)|$661,072|$653,321|$668,036|$57,932|$41,336|$35,532|8.76%|6.33%|5.32%|\\n|Other interest-earning assets (9)|$81,431|$112,549|$75,876|$4,507|$2,865|$653|5.53%|2.55%|0.86%|\\n|Total interest-earning assets|$2,235,278|$2,173,635|$2,144,948|$133,359|$74,573|$50,667|5.97%|3.43%|2.36%|\\n|Non-interest-earning assets (6)|$206,955|$222,388|$202,761| | | | | | |\\n|Total assets|$2,442,233|$2,396,023|$2,347,709| | | | | | |\\n\\n(1) Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs of $101 million, $165 million and $192 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n\\n(2) Interest rates and amounts include the effects of risk management activities associated with the respective asset categories.\\n\\n(3) Monthly or quarterly averages have been used by certain subsidiaries where daily averages are unavailable.\\n\\n(4) Average rates reflect prevailing local interest rates, including inflationary effects and monetary corrections in certain countries.\\n\\n(5) Average volumes of securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are reported net pursuant to ASC 210-20-45.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, including, but not limited to, factor sensitivities, value at risk (VAR) and stress testing. Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including trading mandates, new product approval, permitted product lists and pre-trade approval for larger, more complex and less liquid transactions. These controls enable the monitoring and management of Citi’s top market risks.\\n\\n### Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss) - 12 Months Ended December 31, 2023\\n\\nIn millions of dollars\\n1\\n1\\n1 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 I 8\\n\\n(1) Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic hedges of certain AFS debt securities. Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging derivatives is included in trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected above.\\n---\\n## Factor Sensitivities\\n\\nFactor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury Bond for a one-basis-point change in interest rates. Citi’s Global Market Risk function, within the Independent Risk Management organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated, monitored, and limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios.\\n\\n## Value at Risk (VAR)\\n\\nVAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition, VAR methodologies, and model parameters. As a result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.\\n\\nCiti uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo simulation VAR model, which has been designed to capture\\n\\n## Year-end and Average Trading VAR and Trading and Credit Portfolio VAR\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |Average|Average|\\n|Interest rate|$121|$130|\\n|Credit spread|$59|$78|\\n|Covariance adjustment (1)|($47)|($45)|\\n|Fully diversified interest rate and credit spread (2)|$133|$163|\\n|Foreign exchange|$134|$20|\\n|Equity|$38|$27|\\n|Commodity|$19|$32|\\n|Covariance adjustment (1)|($132)|($94)|\\n|Total trading VAR—all market risk factors, including general and specific risk (excluding credit portfolios) (2)|$192|$148|\\n|Specific risk-only component (3)|($6)|($4)|\\n|Total trading VAR—general market risk factors only (excluding credit portfolios)|$198|$152|\\n|Incremental impact of the credit portfolio (4)|$10|$30|\\n|Total trading and credit portfolio VAR|$202|$178|\\n\\n(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.\\n\\n(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions with the exception of hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option loans, and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.\\n\\n(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR.\\n\\n(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, all associated CVA hedges and market sensitivity FVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included.

In addition, product-specific back-testing on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios across the organization (trading desk level and total Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S. banking regulators.\\n\\nMaterial VAR model and assumption changes must be independently validated within Citi’s Independent Risk Management organization. All model changes, including those for the VAR model, are validated by the model validation group within Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event of significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.\\n\\nCiti uses the same independently validated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above.\\n\\nRegulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR because certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are not eligible\\n---\\n## The following graph presents the daily buy-and-hold profit and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2023. During 2023, three back-testing exceptions were observed at the Citigroup level.\\n\\nThe difference between the 47.7% of days with buy-and-hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 94.6% of days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses, presented in the histogram of daily trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.\\n\\n**Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss - 12 Months Ended December 31, 2023**\\n|In millions of dollars|One-Day Regulatory VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss|\\n|---|---|\\n|(1)|Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-related revenue above.|\\n|(2)|The loss values for mid-August and mid-December 2023 were driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso.|\\n---\\n## Stress Testing\\n\\nCiti manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments, especially those risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.\\n\\nThe systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk, as well as enable the monitoring and managing of Citi’s top market risks.\\n\\nIn general, changes in market values are defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions and market factors, changes in market values are defined over a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a two-month horizon are those that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined.\\n\\n## Operational Risk Overview\\n\\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, including human error or misjudgment, or from external events. This includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, settlements, and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure of Citi to comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses, but excludes strategic and reputation risks. Citi also recognizes the impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with Citi’s business activities.\\n\\nOperational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well as related support functions, and can result in losses. Citi maintains a comprehensive Company-wide risk taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using standardized definitions across Citi’s Operational Risk Management Framework. This taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and expectations inclusive of those related to U.S. Basel III, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), Heightened Standards for Large Financial Institutions and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).\\n---\\nInformation about businesses’ key operational risks, historically operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related information is summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by the Head of Operational Risk Management.\\n\\nOperational risk is measured through Operational Risk Capital and Operational Risk Regulatory Capital for the Advanced Approaches under Basel III. Projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are estimated as a required part of the FRB’s CCAR process.\\n\\nFor additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above.\\n\\nCybersecurity Risk Overview\\n\\nCybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the threat posed by a cyberattack, cyber breach or the failure to protect Citi’s most vital business information assets or operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss (see the operational processes and systems and cybersecurity risk factors in “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). With an evolving threat landscape, ever-increasing sophistication of threat actor tactics, techniques and procedures, ongoing and emerging geopolitical conflicts, and the use of new technologies, including those enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, to conduct financial transactions, Citi and its clients, customers and third parties (and fourth parties, etc.) continue to be at risk from cyberattacks and information security incidents. Citi leverages a threat-focused, defense-in-depth strategy that ensures that multiple controls work in tandem against various threats to increase the likelihood that malicious activity will be prevented, detected and mitigated.\\n\\nCiti has a mature cybersecurity threat identification and management program that relies on an industry-aligned defense-in-depth approach, including an internal cybersecurity intelligence center, participation in industry and government information-sharing programs, vulnerability assessment and scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, security incident and event management systems, firewalls, penetration testing, adversary emulation exercises, data management (including classification, encryption at rest and in transit, and access management), multi-factor authentication requirements and other logical, physical and technical controls designed to prevent, deter, mitigate and respond to cybersecurity threats.\\n\\nCiti’s cyber and information security program is supported by comprehensive governance, including policies, standards and procedures that dictate requirements and best practices around various topics, including, but not limited to, third-party risk management, data management, asset management, information security practices, security incident management, and regulatory and disclosure compliance. Citi’s Chief Information Security Office’s risks and controls are measured against its Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement, which was initially approved by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors and is reapproved annually by Citi’s Risk Committee, chaired by Citi’s Chief Risk Officer. Citi’s Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement leverages key risk indicators to establish enterprise risk tolerance and define risk management strategy with respect to cyber and information security. Further, Citi actively participates in financial industry, government and cross-sector knowledge-sharing groups to enhance individual and collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience.\\n\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Governance\\n\\nCiti’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on Citi’s pree lines of defense, each of which is integrated into Citi’s overall risk management systems and processes.\\nCiti’s Chief Information Security Office, which is led by Citi’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), serves as pe first line of defense. This office provides frontline business, operational and technical controls and capabilities to (1) protect against cybersecurity risks, and (2) respond to cyber incidents and data breaches. Citi manages cybersecurity preats prough its state-of-pe-art fusion centers, which serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber preats.\\nCiti’s Chief Information Security Office is responsible for application and infrastructure defense and security controls, performing vulnerability assessments and pird-party information security assessments (including cybersecurity risk assessments associated wip Citi’s use of products and services from vendors and oper pird-party providers), employee awareness and training programs and security incident management. In each case, pe enterprise information security team works in coordination wip a network of information security officers who are embedded wipin Citi’s global businesses and functions, consistent wip Citi’s philosophy pat all Citi stakeholders have a responsibility in managing cyber and information security risks.\\nCiti’s Technology and Cyber Compliance and Operational Risk Office (TCCORO) serves as pe second line of defense. This office independently evaluates and challenges Citi’s risk mitigation practices and capabilities, from a fused operational risk and compliance lens. It functions as a joint second line of defense and in accordance wip Citi’s Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement. TCCORO also advises first line partners in CISO, supporting enterprise-wide efforts to proactively identify and remediate cybersecurity risks before pey materialize as incidents pat negatively affect business operations.\\nTo address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations, TCCORO monitors cybersecurity legal and regulatory requirements, identifies and defines emerging risks, executes strategic cybersecurity preat assessments, performs new product and initiative reviews, performs data management risk oversight and conducts cybersecurity risk assurance reviews (inclusive of pird-party assessments). In addition, pis office oversees and challenges metrics related to cybersecurity and technology and ensures pey remain aligned wip Citi’s overall operational risk management framework to effectively track, identify and manage risk. TCCORO presents an independent viewpoint on enterprise cybersecurity risk posture, and oversees CISO’s\\n---\\n## cybersecurity risk identification, measurement and enterprise-wide governance of cybersecurity risk.\\n\\nco-chaired by Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Head of O&T and meets at least quarterly. In addition, the committee oversees risk tolerance determinations, reviews emerging threats and their business impacts, commits to appropriate resource levels and investments and supports the continual improvement of the cyber and information security management programs across all of Citi’s businesses and geographies.\\n\\n## Internal Audit\\n\\nserves as Citi’s third line of defense and provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee of the Board on the effectiveness of controls operated by the first and second lines of defense to manage cybersecurity risk.\\n\\n## Outsourcing Risks\\n\\nCiti recognizes the risks associated with outsourcing services to, sharing data with, and/or technologically interacting with third parties. Citi has built a robust third-party information security risk management program that governs third-party engagements from selection, to the establishment of legal agreements that govern the relationship, to ongoing monitoring through the duration of the relationship.\\n\\n## Management Governance\\n\\nCiti’s Head of Operations and Technology (O&T), who reports directly to Citi’s CEO, has overall responsibility for Citi’s first line of defense cyber and information security and technology programs. Citi’s CISO, who reports directly to Citi’s Head of O&T, has primary responsibility to assess and manage Citi’s material risks from cybersecurity threats.\\n\\n## Chief Information Security Office\\n\\nemploys approximately 3,400 individuals to manage its operations.\\n\\n## Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\\n\\nhas primary responsibility for technology policy, innovation enablement, and strategy.\\n\\n## Information Security Risk Committee (ISRC)\\n\\ngoverns enterprise-level risk tolerance, including cybersecurity risk. This committee serves as the most senior cyber and information security forum within Citi and is supported by other committees/forums described below.\\n\\n## Board Governance\\n\\nCiti’s Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight of senior management’s efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Citi’s Board includes members with cybersecurity expertise and experience.\\n---\\nrelated risks. Additionally, Citi’s Board participates in Independent Compliance Risk Management’s (ICRM) cybersecurity exercises to improve preparedness to address primary objectives are to:\\n\\n- Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout Citi;\\n- Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Framework that facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct;\\n- Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, functions and geographies, supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk management processes; and\\n- Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities.\\n\\nThe Board’s Technology Committee receives quarterly updates from the Chief Information Security Office on the cybersecurity threat landscape, regulatory landscape, posture, and strategy and engages in discussions throughout the year with senior management and subject matter experts on the effectiveness of Citi’s overall cybersecurity program.\\n\\nThe Board’s Risk Management Committee (RMC) approved a standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement against which Citi’s performance is measured quarterly. In addition, the RMC oversees Citi’s risk profile, which includes cybersecurity risk, and monitors whether Citi is operating within its cybersecurity risk appetite under its mandate to review key operational risks, including steps taken by management to control such risks.\\n\\nIn the event of a potentially material cybersecurity incident impacting Citi, the Board would be made aware of such incident via lines of communication that run from the Chief Information Security Office to senior management and also to the Board. This contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events includes information and discussion around incident response, legal obligations (including disclosure), and outreach and notification to regulators and customers when needed.\\n\\nFor additional information on the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk management, see Citi’s upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC in March 2024.\\n\\n## COMPLIANCE RISK\\n\\nCompliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to Citi’s customers, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential. It encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical standards and some contractual obligations. It could also include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.\\n\\nCiti seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) Framework (as set forth in the CRM Policy) that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively across Citi, with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account Citi’s risk governance framework and regulatory requirements.\\n\\nTo anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management.\\n\\nCiti has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions. ICRM is responsible for oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and operating within the Compliance Risk Appetite.\\n\\nAs discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB and OCC consent orders, which include improvements to Citi’s CRM Framework and its enterprise-wide application (see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).\\n---\\n## REPUTATION RISK\\n\\nCiti’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust, and Citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its key stakeholders. To support this, Citi has developed a reputation risk framework. Under this framework, Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor corporate activities and operations relative to Citi’s risk appetite. The framework also requires that business segments escalate potential material reputation risks that require review or mitigation through the applicable business Management Forum or Group Reputation Risk Committee.\\n\\nThe Group Reputation Risk Committee and Management Forums, which are composed of Citi’s senior executives, govern the process by which material reputation risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled, escalated, and reported. The Group Reputation Risk Committee and Management Forums determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk appetite and regulatory expectations, while promoting a culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the Company, consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition. The Group Reputation Risk Committee may escalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee or other appropriate committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.\\n\\nEvery Citi employee is responsible for safeguarding Citi’s reputation, guided by Citi’s Code of Conduct. Colleagues are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and actions. They are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present material reputation risk in line with policy.\\n\\n## STRATEGIC RISK\\n\\nAs discussed above, strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market capitalization, or capital, arising from external factors affecting the Company’s operating environment, as well as the risks associated with defining and executing the strategy, which are identified, measured, and managed as part of the Strategic Risk Framework at the Enterprise Level.\\n\\nIn this context, external factors affecting Citi’s operating environment are the economic conditions, geopolitical/political landscape, industry/competitive landscape, customer/client behavior, regulatory/legislative environment, and trends related to investors/shareholders. Material strategic risks that Citi is monitoring include the impacts of an extended period of high inflation and interest rates, as well as macroeconomic uncertainties driven by low global growth and geopolitical issues including the Middle East conflict, the Russia–Ukraine war, and U.S.–China tensions. Heightened regulatory requirements, specifically with regard to capital as well as climate-related transition risk, remain in focus. In addition to external factors affecting Citi’s operating environment, Citi also monitors risks related to the execution of its strategy, with heightened focus on delivering the transformation of its risk and control environment pursuant to the FRB and OCC consent orders.\\n\\n## Climate Risk\\n\\nClimate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi and its clients and customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and comprises both physical risk and transition risk.\\n\\nClimate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver of other categories of risk, such as credit risk from obligors exposed to high climate risk, strategic risks if Citi fails to consider transition risk in client selection, reputational risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing or failing to finance high-carbon industries, and operational risk from physical risks to Citi’s facilities. Citi’s focus on climate risk continues to advance, driven by materiality of strategic, reputation, and financial risk considerations. Citi continues to make progress toward embedding these considerations into its overarching risk management approach.\\n---\\nCiti continues to enhance its methodologies for quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual credit profiles of its clients across various sectors. Citi has developed and embedded sector-specific climate risk assessments in its credit underwriting process for certain sectors that Citi has identified as higher climate risk. Such climate risk assessments are designed to incorporate publicly available client disclosures and data from third-party providers and facilitate conversations with clients on their most material climate risks and management plans for adaptation and mitigation. This helps Citi better understand its clients’ businesses and climate-related risks and support their financial needs. Citi’s Net Zero plan implementation is leading to the further integration of climate risk discussions into client engagement and client selection.\\n\\nCiti also reviews factors related to climate risk under its Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, which includes a focus on climate risk related to financed projects and clients in certain sectors. Considering the credit risk of stranded assets, as well as the reputational risks, Citi’s ESRM Policy describes sector approaches to certain high-carbon sectors, including thermal coal mining and power.\\n\\nFurthermore, Citi continues to participate in financial industry initiatives and develop and pilot methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing the potential financial risks of climate change, including scenario analysis. Citi also continues to monitor regulatory developments on climate risk and sustainable finance and actively engage with regulators on these topics.\\n\\nFor additional information about sustainability and other ESG matters at Citi, see “Climate Change and Net Zero” above.\\n\\nOTHER RISKS\\n\\nLIBOR Transition Risk\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, the USD LIBOR bank panel ended on June 30, 2023. The overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR settings have permanently ceased, and the Financial Conduct Authority is requiring ICE Benchmark Administration to continue publishing one-, three- and six-month USD LIBOR settings using a synthetic methodology, which is based on the relevant CME Term SOFR Reference Rate plus the respective ISDA fixed spread adjustment. These synthetic settings are expected to cease on September 30, 2024. As previously disclosed, as of June 30, 2023, Citi transitioned nearly all of its USD LIBOR-referencing contracts to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment. There remain a de minimis number of unremediated USD LIBOR-referencing contracts that are temporarily utilizing synthetic LIBOR, and Citi is continuing to focus on remediating these remaining contracts.\\n---\\n## Country Risk\\n\\nIn order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 39% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (42% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n## Top 25 Country Exposures\\n\\nThe following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023. (Including the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would represent approximately 99% of Citi’s exposure to all countries as of December 31, 2023.)\\n\\nFor purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland.\\n\\n| |Services, Markets and Banking|Legacy Loans|Wealth Franchises|Loans transferred to HFS (7)|Other funded (2)|Unfunded|Net MTM on derivatives/repos (4)|hedges (CVA)|Trading account assets|Total as of 4Q23|Total as of 3Q23|Total as of 4Q22|Total as a % of Citi|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|United Kingdom|$38.8|$5.2|—|—|$1.5|$39.1|$15.5|($5.3)|$6.7|$104.8|$97.2|$88.5|5.9%|\\n|Ireland| | |15.6|—|—|—|0.3|35.3|0.1|(0.2)|—|0.6|51.7|49.0|47.4|2.9%|\\n|Hong Kong| | |8.8|19.4|—|—|0.2|4.5|1.6|(0.6)|9.8|0.5|44.2|44.2|48.3|2.5%|\\n|Singapore| | |10.0|18.6|—|—|0.4|7.4|1.1|(0.6)|5.8|1.0|43.7|42.3|45.2|2.4%|\\n|Brazil| | |13.7|—|—|—|0.1|3.1|8.1|(1.1)|6.6|2.8|33.3|32.8|28.7|1.9%|\\n|India| | |6.9|—|—|—|0.6|3.6|1.4|(0.6)|9.3|1.2|22.4|22.3|25.3|1.3%|\\n|Germany| | |0.4|—|—|—|—|7.3|5.9|(4.1)|8.2|3.8|21.5|17.4|22.6|1.2%|\\n|China| | |5.7|—|0.4|0.3|0.6|1.3|0.7|(1.4)|8.0|3.3|18.9|18.6|20.7|1.1%|\\n|South Korea| | |3.1|—|5.4|—|0.1|1.5|0.7|(0.7)|7.8|0.5|18.4|20.9|23.7|1.0%|\\n|United Arab Emirates| | |7.6|1.5|—|—|0.2|4.3|0.4|(0.3)|3.7|(0.1)|17.3|16.4|17.4|1.0%|\\n|Poland| | |3.1|—|1.5|—|—|3.3|1.1|(0.2)|6.2|0.1|15.1|13.0|15.6|0.8%|\\n|Australia| | |8.4|0.4|—|—|0.1|5.7|0.5|(1.2)|0.6|0.5|15.0|16.5|14.4|0.8%|\\n|Japan| | |1.7|—|—|—|—|3.8|3.6|(1.9)|4.6|2.6|14.4|15.9|19.0|0.8%|\\n|Canada| | |1.5|1.5|—|—|0.1|6.1|1.4|(2.2)|3.2|2.7|14.3|16.5|15.2|0.8%|\\n|Jersey| | |2.0|2.7|—|—|—|6.7|0.1|(0.1)|0.2|—|11.6|12.1|15.9|0.6%|\\n|Malaysia| | |1.2|—|—|—|0.1|0.8|0.1|(0.1)|3.1|0.1|5.3|5.3|5.4|0.3%|\\n|Czech Republic| | |0.7|—|—|—|—|0.8|2.9|(0.1)|0.9|—|5.2|4.5|4.0|0.3%|\\n|Luxembourg| | |—|0.9|—|—|—|—|0.5|(0.4)|4.0|0.1|5.1|4.9|4.7|0.3%|\\n|Indonesia| | |2.1|—|—|—|—|0.5|0.5|(0.1)|1.4|0.1|4.5|6.1|5.9|0.3%|\\n|Taiwan| | |3.6|—|—|—|—|0.5|0.3|(0.2)|0.2|—|4.4|5.4|13.8|0.2%|\\n|South Africa| | |1.4|—|—|—|—|0.7|0.1|(0.2)|2.4|—|4.4|4.6|4.4|0.2%|\\n|Philippines| | |0.6|—|—|—|0.1|0.2|1.6|(0.3)|2.1|—|4.3|5.2|5.0|0.2%|\\n|Italy| | |0.9|—|—|—|—|2.2|1.8|(1.9)|—|1.0|4.0|3.5|2.4|0.2%|\\n|Thailand| | |1.1|—|—|—|—|0.4|—|—|2.1|0.1|3.7|3.4|4.2|0.2%|\\n\\n(1) Wealth loans reflect funded loans, including those related to the Private Bank, net of unearned income.

Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.\\n\\nAs part of previously disclosed plans, Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi significantly reduced its All Other—Legacy Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank.\\n\\n### Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine on Citi’s Businesses\\n\\nRussia-related Balance Sheet Exposures\\n\\nCiti’s remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency.\\n\\n|In billions of U.S. dollars|December 31, 2023|September 30, 2023|December 31, 2022|Change 4Q23 vs. 3Q23|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Loans|$0.1|$0.2|$0.6|($0.1)|\\n|Investment securities (1)|0.4|0.4|1.1|—|\\n|Net MTM on derivatives/repos (2)|1.4|1.2|1.4|0.2|\\n|Total hedges (on loans and CVA)|—|($0.1)|($0.1)|0.1|\\n|Unfunded (3)|—|—|0.1|—|\\n|Trading accounts assets|—|—|—|—|\\n|Country risk exposure|$1.9|$1.7|$3.1|0.2|\\n|Cash on deposit and placements|0.7|0.6|2.4|0.1|\\n|Deposit Insurance Agency (5)|3.9|3.5|—|0.4|\\n|National Settlements Depository (5)|—|—|1.8|—|\\n|Total third-party exposure (6)|$6.5|$5.8|$7.3|0.7|\\n|Additional exposures to Russian counterparties that are not held by the Russian subsidiary|0.1|0.1|0.2|—|\\n|Total Russia exposure (7)|$6.6|$5.9|$7.5|0.7|\\n\\n(1) Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities.\\n\\n(2) Reverse repurchase agreements are gross of collateral and are included in net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was removed in the second quarter of 2022. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine.\\n\\n(3) Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.\\n\\n(4) Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia and foreign financial institutions.\\n\\n(5) Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA). Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. In accordance with a Central Bank of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred to the DIA in the second quarter of 2023.\\n\\n(6) The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.\\n\\n(7) Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.\\n---\\n## During the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi’s Russia-related Deconsolidation Risk\\n\\nexposures increased by $0.7 billion, as presented in the table above. The increase in exposure was driven by a $0.4 billion appreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar (USD) as well as dividend inflows during the quarter, received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi’s clients. The dividend inflows were partially offset by deposit outflows and tax payments to local authorities. Approximately 71% of Citi’s remaining exposures in Russia are corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which $3.9 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n## Citi’s net investment in Russia\\n\\nwas approximately $0.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 (down from $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023). The decline was due to a reserve build related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.\\n\\n## Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI\\n\\nthrough the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI. When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures.\\n\\n## Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses\\n\\nServices, Markets, Banking, USPB and All Other results have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see “Executive Summary” and each business’s results of operations above.\\n\\n## As of December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s ACL included a $0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct Russian counterparties\\n\\n(unchanged from September 30, 2023). This balance does not include the additional reserves to transfer risk for exposures in Russia.\\n\\n## Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations\\n\\nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately $63 million to-date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $58 million in estimated charges (approximately $2 million in Services, Markets and Banking and $56 million in All Other, excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). This estimate was revised down during the fourth quarter of 2023 from $85 million at September 30, 2023.

Reputational Risks Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties. For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses. While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures. Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations. For additional information on operational and cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above. Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees have received and continue to receive regular reports from senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts. The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the International region, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on The Central Bank of Argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi’s ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. Citi’s net investment in Argentina will therefore continue to be exposed to additional foreign currency translation losses to the extent it is denominated in ARS and is unable to be remitted or exchanged. Furthermore, the capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that\\n\\n## Reputational Risks\\n\\nCiti has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public.

The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the International region, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on\\n\\n## Ukraine\\n\\nCiti has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its Services, Markets and Banking businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s top priority. All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of December 31, 2023, Citi had $1.5 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, unchanged from September 30, 2023.\\n\\n## Argentina\\n\\nCiti operates in Argentina through its Services, Markets and Banking businesses. As of December 31, 2023, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.0 billion (compared to $1.9 billion at September 30, 2023). Citi uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated assets directly in earnings. Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of December 31, 2023, the official ARS exchange rate was 808.48, which devalued by 57% against the USD during the fourth quarter of 2023.\\n\\nThe decline in Citi’s net investment in Argentina during the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily a result of approximately $880 million in translation losses in revenues due to devaluation of the ARS (approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate translation losses in revenues for full-year 2023, compared to approximately $820 million for full-year 2022). The decline in the net investment was also due to reserve builds in the quarter related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Argentina driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. These reductions in the net investment were partially offset by aggregate other net income, consisting of net interest income in Argentina, and interest earned on the net investment, of which a significant portion is invested at high local overnight rates in Argentina.\\n\\nThe Central Bank of Argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi’s ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. Citi’s net investment in Argentina will therefore continue to be exposed to additional foreign currency translation losses to the extent it is denominated in ARS and is unable to be remitted or exchanged. Furthermore, the capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that\\n---\\nsome Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, generally at FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local rates that are significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing Citi’s cross-border disclosures are presented below, based on these alternative mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of exchange mechanisms cannot be used to re-measure Citi’s net the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council monetary assets into USD. If Argentina’s official exchange (FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the key FFIEC rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by reporting guidelines:\\n\\n- Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor, counterparty, collateral (only including qualifying liquid collateral), issuer or guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity but issued by the U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled in Mexico where the underlying collateral is held in Germany is considered German exposure).\\n- Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional amounts.\\n- Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges.\\n- Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity.\\n- Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.\\n\\nGiven the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in some cases significantly, from period to period. As an example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings, all else being equal.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of December 31, 2023, the international NDF market had very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi’s inability to economically hedge its remaining net ARS exposure. Accordingly, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings.\\n\\nOf the $1.0 billion net investment in Argentina as of December 31, 2023, Citi’s net ARS exposure was approximately $0.4 billion. The net ARS exposure is reduced as a result of Citi holding approximately $100 million of USD-denominated loans as well as approximately $500 million of certain local government bonds that are indexed to the higher of the USD exchange rate or the local inflation index. If Citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ARS exposure, Citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the fourth quarter of 2023. Given current economic conditions and the local capital, currency and regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ARS exposure in the future.\\n\\nCiti continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2023.

Note 1 contains a summary of all of Citigroup’s significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi’s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.\\n\\nValuations of Financial Instruments\\n\\nCitigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets, Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities.\\n\\nCiti purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.\\n\\nWhen available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.\\n\\nCiti is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI.\\n---\\n## Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)\\n\\nThe table below presents Citi’s allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and total ACL as of the fourth quarter of 2023. For information on the drivers of Citi’s ACL build in the fourth quarter of 2023, see below.

See “All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” above.\\n\\n(4) Includes ACL on Other assets and Held-to-maturity debt securities. The ACL on Other assets includes ACL related to transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.\\n\\nCiti’s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a R&S timeframe. The R&S forecast period for consumer and corporate loans is eight quarters. The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forward-looking macroeconomic forecast scenarios—base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and certain economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.\\n\\nCiti’s ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period is\\n---\\n## Quantitative Component\\n\\nCiti estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R&S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.\\n\\nAs further discussed below, Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi’s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.\\n\\nThe tables below present Citi’s forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi’s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from 4Q22 to 4Q23:\\n\\n|Quarterly average|8-quarter (1)|\\n|---|---|\\n|U.S. unemployment|1Q24|3Q24|1Q25|average|\\n|Citi forecast at 4Q22|4.6 %|4.5 %|4.4 %|4.4 %|\\n|Citi forecast at 1Q23|4.5|4.5|4.4|4.3|\\n|Citi forecast at 2Q23|4.3|4.5|4.4|4.3|\\n|Citi forecast at 3Q23|4.1|4.3|4.3|4.2|\\n|Citi forecast at 4Q23|4.0|4.3|4.3|4.2|\\n\\n(1) Represents the average unemployment rate for the rolling, forward-looking eight quarters in the forecast horizon.\\n\\n|Year-over-year growth rate|(1)|\\n|---|---|\\n|U.S. real GDP|2023|2024|2025|\\n|Citi forecast at 4Q22|0.3 %|1.5 %|2.2 %|\\n|Citi forecast at 1Q23|1.0|1.0|2.0|\\n|Citi forecast at 2Q23|1.3|0.7|2.0|\\n|Citi forecast at 3Q23|2.1|1.0|2.0|\\n|Citi forecast at 4Q23|2.4|1.4|1.7|\\n\\n## Qualitative Component\\n\\nThe qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL.\\n\\nThe primary examples of these are the following:\\n\\n- Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law\\n- Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties\\n- Normalization of portfolio performance and consumer behavior from low losses as a result of government stimulus and market liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi’s qualitative component of the ACL increased quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily driven by increases in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law, and more specifically, with cross-border and cross-currency exposures in Argentina, based on prevailing economic trends, currency devaluation and geopolitical risk that may impact Argentina’s ability to sustain external debt service, and in Russia for the prolonged political and economic instability. These increases were partially offset by releases of COVID-19–related uncertainty reserves, as the portfolio delinquencies and losses continue to increase, reaching pre-pandemic losses and as risks are captured in the quantitative component of the ACL.\\n\\n## Scenario Weighting\\n\\nCiti’s ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios—base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.\\n\\nCiti’s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi’s downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of 3.2% in the second quarter of 2025. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change in the real (inflation adjusted) GDP level.\\n\\nUnder the base macroeconomic forecast as of 4Q23, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to decline during 2024, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase modestly over the eight-quarter forecast horizon, broadly returning to pre-pandemic levels.\\n---\\n## U.S. real GDP contraction in 2024 of 1.9%, with a peak vulnerable industries and regions. The ACLL reserve balance\\n\\nquarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.2% in the first quarter of 2024.\\n\\nCiti’s ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of December 31, 2023 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple macroeconomic scenarios. Citi’s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions; therefore, applying a 100% downside scenario weight would result in a hypothetical increase in the ACL of approximately $5.2 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost.\\n\\nThis analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n## ACLUC\\n\\nCiti had an ACLUC release of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, which decreased the ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities, to $1.7 billion. The release was primarily driven by releases related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions.\\n\\n## ACL on Other Financial Assets\\n\\nCiti’s ending ACL balance on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.9 billion, compared to $0.8 billion as of September 30, 2023. The net build of $1.1 billion was primarily related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law, and more specifically, to cross-border and cross-currency exposures in Argentina, based on prevailing economic trends, currency devaluation and geopolitical risk that may impact Argentina’s ability to sustain external debt service, and in Russia for the prolonged political and economic instability. See Note 16 for additional information.\\n\\n## Regulatory Capital Impact\\n\\nCiti elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.\\n\\nSee Notes 1 and 16 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts.\\n\\n## 4Q23 Changes in the ACL\\n\\nAs further discussed below, Citi’s ending ACL balance for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $21.8 billion, compared to $20.2 billion as of September 30, 2023. The net build of $1.5 billion is primarily related to (i) an approximate $1.3 billion build for increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Argentina and Russia (see “ACL on Other Financial Assets” below), and (ii) an approximate $0.5 billion build for growth in card balances in USPB. Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of December 31, 2023. See Note 16 for additional information.\\n\\n## Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans\\n\\nCiti’s consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in USPB. Citi’s total consumer ACLL build was $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by growth in U.S. cards balances, resulting in a December 31, 2023 ACLL balance of $15.4 billion, or 3.97% of total funded consumer loans.\\n\\nFor U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans decreased to 7.67% as of December 31, 2023, due to seasonal improvement, compared to 7.81% at September 30, 2023. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.25% at December 31, 2023, compared to 1.24% at September 30, 2023.\\n\\n## Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans\\n\\nCiti had a corporate ACLL build of less than $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The build was primarily driven by loan growth and was mainly offset by releases related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions.\\n\\n## Goodwill\\n\\nCiti tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi’s stock price.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s activities were conducted through the reportable operating segments: Services, Markets, Banking, USPB and Wealth, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other, which includes activities not assigned to a specific operating segment as well as discontinued operations. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level below the operating segment (referred to as a reporting unit).\\n---\\n## Citi performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023\\n\\nwhich resulted in no impairment of any of Citi’s reporting units’ goodwill.\\n\\n## Citi’s Segment Structure Reorganization\\n\\nThe reorganization of Citi’s segment structure, including the change of management, and the business realignment between Banking and Markets were identified as triggering events for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of ASC 350, additional interim goodwill impairment tests were performed as of December 13, 2023, which resulted in no impairment during the fourth quarter. Additionally, goodwill was reallocated from Banking to Markets related to the business realignment based on their relative fair values using the valuation performed as of the effective date of the reorganization. No additional triggering events were identified and no goodwill was impaired during 2023.\\n\\n## Goodwill Impairment Testing\\n\\nBased on the fourth-quarter assessments, the results of the impairment tests showed that the fair values of Citi’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values for all reporting units. The impairment tests results also showed that the fair value of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 106%, with the carrying value including approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.\\n\\n## Valuation Techniques\\n\\nGoodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of a reporting unit can be supported by its fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earnings multiples and/or transaction multiples) and/or the income approach (discounted cash flow (DCF) method). In applying these methodologies, Citi utilizes a number of factors, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.\\n\\n## Independent Valuation Specialist\\n\\nSimilar to 2022, Citi engaged an independent valuation specialist in 2023 to assist in Citi’s valuation of all the reporting units, primarily employing both the income and market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. The income approach utilized discount rates that Citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets in the internally generated cash flow projections. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. Management uses judgment in the selection of comparable companies and includes those with the most similar business activities.\\n\\n## Income Taxes\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nCiti is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and local municipalities and the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which Citi operates. These tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit.\\n\\n### Litigation Accruals\\n\\nSee the discussion in Note 30 for Citi’s policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies.\\n\\n### Income Taxes\\n\\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, Citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Citi must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, based on enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets (DTAs) are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more-likely.\\n---\\nthan-not. For example, if it is more-likely-than-not that a Net DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted carry-forward would expire unused, Citi would set up a valuation allowance against that DTA. Citi has established valuation allowances as described below.\\n\\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), beginning in 2018, Citi is taxed on income generated by its U.S. operations at a federal tax rate of 21%. The effect on Citi’s state tax rate is dependent upon how and when the individual states that have not yet addressed the federal tax law changes choose to adopt the various new provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\\n\\nCiti’s non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries are subject to tax at their local tax rates. Non-U.S. branches also continue to be subject to U.S. taxation. The impact of this on Citi’s earnings depends on the level of branch pretax income, the local branch tax rate, and allocations of overall domestic loss (ODL) and expenses for U.S. tax purposes to branch earnings. Citi expects no residual U.S. tax on such earnings. With respect to non-U.S. subsidiaries, dividends from these subsidiaries will be excluded from U.S. taxation. While the majority of Citi’s non-U.S. subsidiary earnings are classified as global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), Citi expects no material residual U.S. tax on such earnings based on its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ local tax rates, which exceed, on average, the effective 13.125% GILTI tax rate. Finally, Citi does not expect the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) to affect its tax provision.\\n\\nOn January 4, 2022, final FTC regulations were published in the Federal Register, which eliminate the creditability of foreign taxes paid in certain situations. These include countries that do not align with U.S. tax principles in significant part and for services performed outside the recipient country. In 2023, the IRS announced that the effective date of these regulations was deferred until the IRS gives notice otherwise. The impact on Citi’s effective tax rate is not expected to be material.\\n\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both effective January 1, 2023. The corporate AMT is a 15% minimum tax on financial statement income after adjusting for foreign taxes paid. Corporate AMT paid in one year is creditable against regular corporate tax liability in future years. Citi does not expect to pay material amounts of corporate AMT given its profitability and tax profile.\\n\\nThe 1% excise tax is a non-deductible tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased in the taxable year, reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued in the same year. See Note 11 for the 2023 impact on earnings per share related to the excise tax.\\n\\nDeferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances (VA)\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, Citi had net DTAs of $29.6 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi’s DTAs increased by $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of the geographic mix of earnings. On a full-year basis, Citi’s DTAs increased by $1.9 billion from $27.7 billion at December 31, 2022.\\n\\nOf Citi’s total net DTAs of $29.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, $12.8 billion, primarily related to tax carry-forwards, was deducted in calculating Citi’s regulatory capital.\\n\\nNet DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted from regulatory capital if in excess of the 10%/15% limitations (see “Capital Resources” above). For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, Citi had $2.3 billion of disallowed temporary difference DTAs (included in the $12.8 billion above). The remaining $16.8 billion of net DTAs as of December 31, 2023 was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III standards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules.\\n\\nCiti’s total VA at December 31, 2023 was $3.6 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the generation of current-year FTCs in the branch basket. Citi’s VA of $3.6 billion is composed of $1.9 billion on its FTC branch basket carry-forwards, $1.2 billion on its U.S. residual DTA related to its non-U.S. branches, $0.4 billion on local non-U.S. DTAs and $0.1 billion on state net operating loss carry-forwards.\\n\\nAs stated above with regard to the impact of non-U.S. branches on Citi’s earnings, the level of branch pretax income, the local branch tax rate, and the allocations of ODL and expenses for U.S. tax purposes to the branch basket are the main factors in determining the branch VA. The allocated ODL was affected by reduced taxable income generated in the current year.\\n\\nRecognized FTCs comprised approximately $1.2 billion of Citi’s DTAs as of December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in FTCs year-over-year was primarily due to current-year usage. The FTC carry-forward period represents the most time-sensitive component of Citi’s DTAs.\\n\\nCiti had an ODL of approximately $7 billion at December 31, 2023, which allows Citi to elect a percentage between 50% and 100% of future years’ domestic source income to be reclassified as foreign source income. (See Note 10 for a description of the ODL.)\\n\\nThe majority of Citi’s U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forward and all of its New York State and City net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to a carry-forward period of 20 years. This provides enough time to fully utilize the net DTAs pertaining to these existing net operating loss carry-forwards. This is due to Citi’s forecast of sufficient U.S. taxable income and the continued taxation of Citi’s non-U.S. income by New York State and City.\\n\\nAlthough realization is not assured, Citi believes that the realization of its recognized net DTAs of $29.6 billion at December 31, 2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on management’s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes). Citi has concluded that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the realization of its net DTAs after taking its VAs into consideration.\\n\\nSee Note 10 for additional information on Citi’s income taxes, including its income tax provision, tax assets and liabilities and a tabular summary of Citi’s net DTAs balance as of December 31, 2023 (including the FTCs and applicable expiration dates of the FTCs). For information on Citi’s ability to use its DTAs, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above and Note 10.\\n---\\n## Accounting Changes\\n\\nSee Note 1 for a discussion of changes in accounting standards.\\n\\n## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\n\\nCiti’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\n\\nCiti’s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.\\n\\nCiti’s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\\n---\\n## MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\\n\\nCiti’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Citi’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Citi’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Citi’s assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that Citi’s receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of Citi’s management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Citi’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\\n\\nCiti’s management assessed the effectiveness of Citigroup’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, Citi’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. In addition, there were no changes in Citi’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Citi’s internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of Citi’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, Citi’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report below, which expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Citi’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\\n---\\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\n\\nCertain statements in this report, including but not limited to statements included within the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Citigroup also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed with or furnished to the SEC, and its management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.\\n\\nGenerally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent Citigroup’s and its management’s beliefs regarding future events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target and illustrative, and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could.\\n\\nSuch statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results of operations and financial conditions, including capital and liquidity, may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including without limitation (i) the precautionary statements included within the “Executive Summary” and each business’s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and (ii) the factors listed and described under “Risk Factors” above.\\n\\nAny\\n---\\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\n\\nKPMG\\n\\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors Our audits of the consolidated financial statements Citigroup Inc.: included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\n\\n### Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\n\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S.\\n---\\n#### Assessment of the fair value of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis\\n\\nAs described in Notes 1, 26 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $896.8 billion, net and $347.6 billion, net, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The Company estimated the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis ($12.7 billion and $48.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023) utilizing various valuation techniques with one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers being unobservable including, but not limited to, complex internal valuation models, alternative pricing procedures or comparables analysis and discounted cash flows. We identified the assessment of the measurement of fair value for certain Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as a critical audit matter. A high degree of effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the Level 3 fair values due to measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the fair value methodology, including methods, models and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. Significant assumptions include proxy data, forecast data, the extrapolation and interpolation of proxy data, forecast data, and historic data as well as certain model assumptions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the valuation models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s Level 3 fair value measurements including controls over:\\n\\n- valuation methodologies, including significant assumptions\\n- independent price verification\\n- evaluating that significant model assumptions reflected those which a market participant would use to determine an exit price in the current market environment\\n- the valuation models used were mathematically accurate and appropriate to value the financial instruments and\\n- relevant information used within the Company’s models that was reasonably available was considered in the fair value determination.\\n\\n#### Assessment of the allowance for credit losses collectively evaluated for impairment\\n\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $19.9 billion as of December 31, 2023, which includes the allowance related to loans and unfunded lending commitments collectively evaluated for impairment (the collective ACLL). The expected credit losses for the quantitative component of the collective ACLL is the product of multiplying the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) for consumer and corporate loans. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on three macroeconomic scenarios (base, downside and upside) multiplied by their respective scenario weights, which take into consideration both internal and external forecasted macroeconomic variables over a reasonable and supportable period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the forecasted economic variables and losses based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. The qualitative component considers idiosyncratic events and the uncertainty of forward-looking economic scenarios not captured in the quantitative models. For consumer U.S. credit cards, the Company utilizes the payment rate approach to determine the payments needed to pay off the end-of-period balance. This approach incorporates payment rate curves and is used to estimate EAD. Reserves for unconditionally cancelable accounts are based on the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date and do not include undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable. In addition, the models used for consumer U.S. credit card loans take into account leading credit indicators. For corporate loans, the models consider the credit quality as measured by risk ratings and economic factors.\\n\\nWe identified the assessment of the collective ACLL, specifically the quantitative component for the consumer U.S. credit cards and corporate portfolios, and the qualitative component for the corporate portfolio as a critical audit matter. Auditing the assessment involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment, and specialized skills and knowledge as well as experience in the industry. Our assessment encompassed the evaluation of the various components of the collective ACLL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD, LGD, and EAD.\\n---\\n## certain key assumptions and inputs for the Company’s\\n\\nby inspecting the model documentation to determine quantitative and qualitative components. The key assumptions and inputs for consumer U.S. credit card loans encompass loan delinquencies, certain credit indicators, such as FICO scores, and expected life as well as the reasonable and supportable forecasts for key economic variables. The key economic variables include U.S. unemployment (UER) and U.S. housing prices (HPI), which are utilized by the models. The key assumptions and inputs for corporate loans encompass risk ratings, credit conversion factor for unfunded lending commitments, and reasonable and supportable forecast for key economic variables. The key economic variables include U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) and UER, which are utilized by the model. The key assumptions and inputs for the qualitative component for corporate loan portfolios include potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainty including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices, and geopolitical tensions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD, LGD, and EAD models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.\\n\\n## Evaluation of goodwill in the Wealth, Markets and U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) reporting units\\n\\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023 was $20.1 billion, of which $4.5 billion related to Wealth, $5.2 billion related to Markets and $5.4 billion related to USPB as of October 1, 2023, prior to the Markets and Banking business realignment.\\n\\n|Goodwill Balance|As of December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|\\n|Wealth|$4.5 billion|\\n|Markets|$5.2 billion|\\n|USPB|$5.4 billion|\\n\\nThe Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit likely exceeds its fair value. This involves estimating the fair value of the reporting units using both discounted cash flow analyses and a market multiples approach. The Company performed its annual assessment on October 1, 2023. We identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for Wealth, Markets, and USPB as of October 1, 2023 as a critical audit matter.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company identified the reorganization described in Note 3 as a triggering event due to a change in management for Markets, Banking, Services, USPB, and Wealth and the business realignment between Banking and Markets. The Company performed additional goodwill impairment testing as of December 13, 2023, the effective date of the reorganization. The evaluation of goodwill impairment testing as of December 13, 2023 was not identified as a critical audit matter.\\n\\nThe evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for Wealth, Markets, and USPB as of October 1, 2023 was identified as a critical audit matter because as of October 1, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Wealth, Markets, and USPB reporting units marginally exceeded their carrying values at the conclusion of impairment tests. This indicated a higher risk due to measurement uncertainty that the goodwill may be impaired and, therefore, involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the\\n---\\nevaluation of the key assumptions used in estimating the We compared the Company’s historical forecasts to fair value of the Wealth, Markets, and USPB reporting actual results at a consolidated level to assess the units, which include the long-term growth rate, discount Company’s ability to accurately forecast key metrics such rate, exit multiple assumptions, certain forecasted as revenues and operating expenses. We also compared macroeconomic assumptions used to inform the prior year actuals to the expected trends for revenues and forecasted income by reporting unit, and forecasted operating expenses at the reporting unit level to assess the revenues and operating expenses by reporting unit used in Company’s ability to achieve their forecasts. We the discounted cash flow analyses. compared the Company’s fourth quarter 2023 forecasts to actual fourth quarter 2023 results at the reporting unit The following are the primary procedures we level to assess the Company’s ability to accurately performed to address this critical audit matter.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nThroughout these Notes, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and the “Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain reclassifications and updates have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements and notes to conform to the current period’s presentation.\\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control. Entities in which the Company holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant influence, other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss) is included in Other revenue. Income from investments in less-than-20%-owned companies is recognized when dividends are received. As discussed in more detail in Note 23, Citigroup also consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings and other investments are included in Other revenue.\\n\\nCitibank\\n\\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a commercial bank and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup. Citibank’s principal offerings include investment banking, commercial banking, cash management, trade finance and e-commerce; private banking products and services; consumer finance, credit cards and mortgage lending; and retail banking products and services.\\n\\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\\n\\nAn entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets either of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation, which are (i) the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or expected returns. The Company consolidates a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and a right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE (that is, Citi is the primary beneficiary). In addition to variable interests held in consolidated VIEs, the Company has variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary.\\n\\nAll unconsolidated VIEs are monitored by the Company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause its primary beneficiary status to change. All entities not deemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of ASC 810. See Note 23 for more detailed information.\\n\\nForeign Currency Translation\\n\\nAssets and liabilities of Citi’s foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars using period-end spot foreign exchange rates. The effects of those translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of any related hedge and tax effects, until realized upon sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign entity, at which point such amounts are reclassified into earnings. Revenues and expenses of Citi’s foreign operations are translated monthly from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at amounts that approximate weighted-average exchange rates.\\n\\nFor transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, including transactions denominated in the local currencies of foreign operations that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, the effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included in Principal transactions, along with the related effects of any economic hedges. Instruments used to hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts and, in certain instances, designated issues of non-U.S.-dollar debt. Foreign operations in countries with highly inflationary economies designate the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, with the effects of changes in exchange rates primarily included in Other revenue.\\n\\nInvestment Securities\\n\\nInvestments include debt and equity securities. Debt securities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and structured securities that are subject to prepayment risk. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stock.\\n\\nDebt Securities\\n\\n- Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) are securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue.\\n- Debt securities classified as “available-for-sale” (AFS) are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of applicable income taxes and hedges. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue.\\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n1.

Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stock.\\n\\nDebt Securities\\n\\n- Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) are securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue.\\n- Debt securities classified as “available-for-sale” (AFS) are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of applicable income taxes and hedges. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue.\\n---\\nFor investments in debt securities classified as HTM or transactions, except when included in a hedging relationship. AFS, accrued interest is subject to the Company’s non-accrual Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory policy, which results in the timely write-off of accrued interest.\\n\\nInvestment securities not measured at fair value through earnings include (i) debt securities held in HTM or AFS, (ii) equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative or equity method, (iii) Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and (iv) certain exchange memberships. These securities are subject to evaluation for impairment as described in Note 16 for HTM securities and in Note 14 for AFS, measurement alternative and equity method investments. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in earnings, primarily on a specific identification basis.\\n\\nThe Company uses a number of valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value, which are described in Note 26.\\n\\n## Equity Securities\\n\\n|Marketable equity securities|are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities|are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost. Non-marketable equity securities under the measurement alternative are carried at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting from observed prices for orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.|\\n|Certain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method|are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, since the Company elected to apply fair value accounting.|\\n\\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities\\n\\nTrading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in Note 27, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account assets.\\n\\nTrading account liabilities include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value (as described in Note 27).\\n\\nOther than physical commodities inventory, all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest income on trading assets is recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities.\\n\\nPhysical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with related losses reported in Principal\\n---\\nrepo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet—Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements, are met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s policy is to take possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The Company monitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.\\n\\nAs described in Note 26, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions.\\n\\n## Loans\\n\\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs, except for credit card receivable balances, which include accrued interest and fees. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans.\\n\\nAs described in Note 27, Citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate.\\n\\nLoans that are held-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of unearned income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from the investing activities category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in loans. However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from held-for-investment to held-for-sale (HFS), the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans.\\n\\n## Consumer Loans\\n\\nConsumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the USPB, Wealth and All Other—Legacy Franchises businesses (except Mexico SBMM loans).\\n\\n### Consumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies\\n\\nAs a general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both open- and closed-end) loans when payments are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. As a result of OCC guidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Also as a result of OCC guidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy, with the exception of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)–insured loans.\\n\\n### Consumer Charge-Off Policies\\n\\nCiti’s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below:\\n\\n|Loan Type|Charge-Off Criteria|\\n|---|---|\\n|Unsecured installment loans|Charged off at 120 days contractually past due.|\\n|Unsecured revolving loans and credit card loans|Charged off at 180 days contractually past due.|\\n|Loans secured with non-real estate collateral|Written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days contractually past due.|\\n|Real estate-secured loans|Written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. Charged off no later than 180 days contractually past due if a decision has been made not to foreclose on the loans.|\\n|Unsecured loans in bankruptcy|Charged off within 60 days of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, whichever occurs earlier.|\\n|Real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy|Written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, whichever is earlier.|\\n---\\n## Corporate Loans\\n\\nCorporate loans represent loans and leases managed by Services, Markets and Banking and the Mexico SBMM component of All Other—Legacy Franchises. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days past due and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan.\\n\\nImpaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are carried at the lower of amortized cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms.\\n\\n## Loans Held-for-Sale\\n\\nCorporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans HFS and included in Other assets. The practice of Citi’s U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as HFS and the fair value option is elected at origination, with changes in fair value recorded in Other revenue. With the exception of those loans for which the fair value option has been elected, HFS loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other revenue. The related cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line Change in loans HFS. Gains and losses on loans HFS are generally presented in Other revenue. Gains on sales of fully or partially charged-off loans are presented as gross credit recoveries in the Provision for credit losses up to the amount of prior charge-offs.\\n\\n## Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)\\n\\nThe current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable (R&S) forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported financial asset balances. If the asset’s life extends beyond the R&S forecast period, then historical experience is considered over the remaining life of the assets in the ACL. The resulting ACL is adjusted in each subsequent reporting period through Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income to reflect changes in history, current conditions and forecasts as well as changes in asset positions.\\n---\\n## The following are the main factors and interpretations that Citi considers when estimating the ACL under the CECL methodology:\\n\\n- CECL reserves are estimated over the contractual term of the financial asset, which is adjusted for expected prepayments. Expected extensions are generally not considered unless the option to extend the loan cannot be canceled unilaterally by Citi.\\n- Credit enhancements that are not freestanding (such as those that are included in the original terms of the contract or those executed in conjunction with the lending transaction) are considered loss mitigants for purposes of CECL reserve estimation.\\n- For unconditionally cancelable accounts (generally credit cards), reserves are based on the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date (assuming no further charges) and do not include any undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable. Reserves are included for undrawn commitments for accounts that are not unconditionally cancelable (such as letters of credit and corporate loan commitments, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), undrawn mortgage loan commitments, and financial guarantees).\\n- CECL models are designed to be economically sensitive. They utilize the macroeconomic forecasts provided by Citi’s enterprise scenario group that are approved by senior management. Analysis is performed and documented to determine the necessary qualitative management adjustment (QMA) to capture idiosyncratic events and model uncertainty.\\n- The portion of the forecast that reflects the enterprise scenario group’s R&S period indicates the maximum length of time its models can produce a R&S macroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion reflecting historical loss experience is used for the remaining life of the loan to estimate expected credit losses. For the loss forecast, businesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as determined to be appropriate and justifiable.\\n- Citi’s ability to forecast credit losses over the R&S period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a reasonable and supportable time window. The R&S period reflects the overall ability to have a reasonable and supportable forecast of credit loss based on economic forecasts. The R&S forecast period for consumer and corporate loans is eight quarters.\\n- The loss models consume all or a portion of the R&S economic forecast and then revert to historical loss experience.\\n- The ACL incorporates provisions for accrued interest on products that are not subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy (e.g., credit cards, etc.).\\n- Citi uses the most recent available information to inform its macroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for analysis of the results and corresponding approvals. Key variables are reviewed for significant changes through year end, and changes to portfolio positions are reflected in the ACL.\\n\\n## Quantitative and Qualitative Components of the ACL\\n\\nThe loss likelihood and severity models use both internal and external information and are sensitive to forecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the quantitative component, Citi uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios and associated probabilities to estimate the ECL. Estimates of these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup’s internal system of credit risk ratings, (ii) historical default and loss data, including comprehensive internal history and rating agency information regarding default rates and internal data on the severity of losses in the event of default, and (iii) a R&S forecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined primarily by utilizing models for the borrowers’ PD, LGD, and EAD.\\n\\n## Consumer Loans\\n\\nFor consumer loans, most portfolios including North America cards, mortgages, and personal installment loans (PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD, and EAD loss forecasting models. Some smaller international portfolios are covered by econometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL) rate is forecast. The modeling of all retail products is performed by examining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these drivers relate to exposures with similar credit risk characteristics and consider past events, current conditions, and R&S forecasts. Under the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and recoveries are captured on an undiscounted basis. Citi incorporates adjustments needed to the modeled expected losses in the quantitative calculations through a qualitative adjustment.\\n---\\nexpected recoveries on loans into its reserve estimate, exposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan exposures including expected recoveries on assets previously written off. The Company considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero for U.S. Treasuries and U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such, Citi does not have an ACL for these securities. For all other HTM debt securities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and discounting techniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding the likelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured securities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the underlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to HTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used for corporate HFI loans.\\n\\nCiti does not establish reserves for the uncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer products, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy at 90 days past due. As such, only the principal balance is subject to the CECL reserve methodology and interest does not attract a further reserve.\\n\\nFor credit cards, Citi uses the payment rate approach, which leverages payment rate curves, to determine the payments that should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period balance (CECL balance) in the estimation of EAD. The payment rate approach uses customer payment behavior (payment rate) to establish the portion of the CECL balance that will be paid each month. These payment rates are defined as the percentage of principal payments received in the respective month divided by the prior month’s billed principal balance. The liquidation (CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is determined by multiplying the CECL balance by that period’s forecasted payment rate. The cumulative sum of these payments less the CECL balance produces the balance liquidation curve. Citi does not apply a non-accrual policy to credit card receivables; rather, they are subject to full charge-off at 180 days past due or bankruptcy. As such, the entire customer balance up until write-off, including accrued interest and fees, is subject to the CECL reserve methodology.\\n\\nCorporate Loans, HTM Securities and Other Assets\\n\\n|Category|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Citi records allowances for credit losses on all financial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope of CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI, HTM debt securities and Other assets.| |\\n|Discounting techniques are applied for corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities. All cash flows are fully discounted to the reporting date.| |\\n|The ACL includes Citi’s estimate of all credit losses expected to be incurred over the estimated full contractual life of the financial asset.| |\\n|The contractual life of the financial asset does not include expected extensions, renewals or modifications.| |\\n|Where Citi has an unconditional option to extend the contractual term, Citi does not consider the potential extension in determining the contractual term; however, where the borrower has the sole right to exercise the extension option without Citi’s approval, Citi does consider the potential extension in determining the contractual term.| |\\n\\nThe Company primarily bases its ACL on models that assess the likelihood and severity of credit events and their impact on cash flows under R&S forecasted economic scenarios. Allowances consider the probability of the borrower’s default, the loss the Company would incur upon default and the borrower’s exposure at default. Such models discount the present value of all future cash flows, using the asset’s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a more simplified approach based on historical loss rates to certain loans modified in accordance with the CARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are not classified as TDRs.\\n\\nOther Financial Assets with Zero Expected Credit Losses\\n\\nFor certain financial assets, zero expected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on there being no history of loss and the nature of the receivables.\\n\\nSecured Financing Transactions\\n\\nMost of Citi’s reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing arrangements and margin loans require that the borrower continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing Citi’s interest, primarily resulting from changes in the fair value of such collateral. In such arrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by which the asset’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the collateral is equal to or exceeds the asset’s amortized cost basis, as Citi does not expect to incur credit losses on such well-collateralized exposures. For certain margin loans presented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, ACLL is estimated using the same approach as corporate loans.\\n\\nAccrued Interest\\n\\nCECL permits entities to make an accounting policy election not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a policy in place that will result in timely reversal or write-off of interest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off policy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest at 90 days past due. For HTM debt securities, Citi established a non-accrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued interest. For corporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy is used, Citi has elected to recognize an ACL on accrued interest receivable. The LGD models for corporate loans include an adjustment for estimated accrued interest.\\n\\nReasonably Expected TDRs (in 2022 and prior years)\\n\\nFor corporate loans, the reasonable expectation of the TDR concept requires that the contractual life over which ECLs are estimated be extended when a TDR that results in a tenor extension is reasonably expected. Reasonably expected TDRs are included in the life of the asset. A discounting technique or collateral-dependent practical expedient is used for non-accrual and TDR loan exposures that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and are individually assessed. Loans modified in accordance with the CARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are not classified as TDRs.\\n---\\nIn 2023, the reasonably expected TDRs accounting was contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayments, and replaced by modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing expected cash flows at the date of recognition.\\n\\nReserve Estimates and Policies\\n\\nManagement provides reserves for an estimate of lifetime ECLs in the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of an ACL. These reserves are established in accordance with Citigroup’s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with risk management and finance representatives for each applicable business area. Applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are assigned (primarily Services, Markets, Banking and Wealth) and delinquency-managed portfolios (primarily USPB) or modified consumer loans, where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties. The aforementioned representatives for these business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data discussed below.\\n\\nEstimated Credit Losses for Portfolios of Performing Exposures\\n\\nRisk management and finance representatives who cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends, including current and future housing prices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, costs to sell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for each product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.\\n\\nRisk management and finance representatives who cover business areas with classifiably managed portfolios present their recommended reserve balances based on the frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, size and diversity of individual large credits, and ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing. Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance.\\n\\nConsumer\\n\\nCiti does not purchase whole portfolios of PCD assets in its retail businesses. However, there may be a small portion of a purchased portfolio that is identified as PCD at the purchase date. Interest income recognition does not vary between PCD and non-PCD assets. A consumer financial asset is considered to be more-than-insignificantly credit deteriorated if it is more than 30 days past due at the purchase date.\\n\\nCorporate\\n\\nCiti generally classifies wholesale loans and debt securities classified as HTM or AFS as PCD when both of the following criteria are met: (i) the purchase price discount is at least 10% of par and (ii) the purchase date is more than 90 days after the origination or issuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial interests rated AA- and lower obtained at origination from certain securitization transactions as PCD when there is a significant difference (i.e., 10% or greater) between\\n\\ncriteria are met: (i) the purchase price discount is at least 10% of par and (ii) the purchase date is more than 90 days after the origination or issuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial interests rated AA- and lower obtained at origination from certain securitization transactions as PCD when there is a significant difference (i.e., 10% or greater) between\\n\\nCorporate loan EAD models include an incremental usage factor (or credit conversion factor) to estimate ECLs on amounts undrawn at the reporting date. Off-balance sheet commitments include unfunded exposures, revolving facilities, securities underwriting commitments, letters of credit, HELOCs and financial guarantees (excluding performance guarantees). This reserve is classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other liabilities. Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in Provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments.\\n---\\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\\n\\nMortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n\\nFor additional information on the Company’s MSRs, see Notes 17 and 22.\\n\\nGoodwill\\n\\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has determined that its reporting units are at the reportable operating segment level or one level below.\\n\\nThe Company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company must perform the quantitative test.\\n\\nThe Company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly to the quantitative test.\\n\\nThe quantitative test requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\\n\\nUpon any business disposition, goodwill is allocated to, and derecognized with, the disposed business based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the fair value of the reporting unit.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company voluntarily changed its annual impairment assessment date from July 1 to October 1.\\n\\nAdditional information on Citi’s goodwill impairment testing can be found in Note 17.\\n\\nIntangible Assets\\n\\nIntangible assets—including core deposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, credit card contract-related intangibles, other customer relationships and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRs—are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Credit card contract-related intangibles include fixed and unconditional\\n\\ncosts incurred to renew or extend the contract with a card partner. In estimating the useful life of a credit card contract-related intangible, the Company considers the probability of contract renewal or extension to determine the period that the asset is expected to contribute future cash flows. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.\\n\\nPremises and Equipment\\n\\nPremises and equipment includes lease right-of-use assets, property and equipment (including purchased and developed software), net of depreciation and amortization. Substantially all lease right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and substantially all property and equipment is depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset.\\n\\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities\\n\\nOther assets include, among other items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets, equity method investments, interest and fees receivable, repossessed assets, other receivables and assets from businesses classified as HFS that are reclassified from other balance sheet line items. Other liabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses, lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities, reserves for legal claims and legal fee accruals, taxes, unfunded lending commitments, repositioning reserves, other payables and liabilities from businesses classified as HFS that are reclassified from other balance sheet line items. Legal fee accruals are recognized as incurred.\\n\\nOther Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets\\n\\nReal estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in Other assets, net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair value.\\n\\nSecuritizations\\n\\nThere are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. Citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity must be consolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under GAAP.\\n\\nIf the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary (as discussed in “Variable Interest Entities” above). For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party has voting control of the entity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup are consolidated.\\n\\nInterests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and servicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts.\\n---\\nwhich is not in securitized form. In the case of consolidated Instrument-Specific Credit Risk securitization entities, including the credit card trusts, these retained interests are not reported on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain on the Balance Sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, except for MSRs, which are included in Intangible assets on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nDebt Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for at amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to report the debt instruments (including certain structured notes) at fair value, or debt that is in a fair value hedging relationship. Premiums, discounts and issuance costs on long-term debt accounted for at amortized cost are amortized over the contractual term using the effective interest method.\\n\\nTransfers of Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale, (i) the assets must be legally isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred (or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and asset-backed financing activities through the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests), and (iii) the Company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the assets are removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the Company’s liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has continuing involvement with the assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting, that opinion must state that the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the Company’s other assets in the event of the Company’s insolvency.\\n\\nRisk Management Activities—Derivatives Used for Hedging Purposes The Company manages its exposures to market movements outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, purchased options and commodities, as well as foreign-exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities.\\n---\\n## Deferred Taxes\\n\\nDeferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment about whether realization is more-likely-than-not. ASC 740, Income Taxes, sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves.\\n\\n## Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Flows\\n\\nCash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks. Certain cash balances are restricted by regulatory or contractual requirements. See Note 28 for additional information on restricted cash.\\n\\n## Related Party Transactions\\n\\nThe Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin accounts, derivative transactions, charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the ordinary course of business.\\n\\n## Accounting Changes\\n\\nTDRs and Vintage Disclosures\\n\\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023, including the guidance on the recognition and measurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach.\\n\\nAdopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of $352 million and an increase in other assets related to held-for-sale businesses of $40 million, with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $290 million and a decrease in deferred tax assets of $102 million on January 1, 2023. The ACL for corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement approach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this ASU.\\n\\nASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With the elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably expected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term over which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for modified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be based on the fair value of the collateral.\\n\\n## Consumer Loans\\n\\nUpon adoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the use of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all consumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate discounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the borrowers’ probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi collectively evaluates smaller-balance.\\n\\n## Commissions, Underwriting and Principal Transactions\\n\\nCommissions and fees revenues are recognized in income when earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-date basis. See Note 5 for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies for Commissions and fees, and Note 6 for details of Principal transactions revenue.\\n\\n## Earnings per Share\\n\\nEarnings per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. Undistributed earnings are calculated after deducting preferred stock dividends, any issuance cost incurred at the time of issuance of redeemed preferred stock and dividends paid and accrued to common stocks and RSU/DSA share awards. Citi grants restricted and deferred share awards under its shares-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Company’s common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities and are not included in computing basic EPS.\\n\\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, stock options and awards, which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Anti-dilutive options and warrants are disregarded in the EPS calculations. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS.\\n\\n## Use of Estimates\\n\\nManagement must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes. Such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements. See Note 26 for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the amounts of other.\\n---\\nhomogeneous loans formerly considered TDRs for expected can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance. In 2020, credit losses, whereas previously those loans had been individually evaluated.\\n\\nThe ASU also requires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of those types of modifications. In addition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of loan origination (vintage). The amendments related to disclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning as of the date of adoption. See Note 14 for these new disclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.\\n\\nLong-Duration Insurance Contracts\\n\\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services—Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that are impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12.\\n\\nCiti adopted the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $39 million decrease in Other liabilities and a $27 million increase in AOCI, after-tax.\\n\\nFair Value Hedging—Portfolio Layer Method\\n\\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging—Portfolio Layer Method, intended to better align hedge accounting with an organization’s risk management strategies. Specifically, the guidance expands the current single-layer method to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed portfolio of qualifying assets, which include both prepayable and non-prepayable assets. Upon the adoption of the guidance, entities may elect to reclassify securities held-to-maturity to the available-for-sale category provided that the reclassified securities are designated in a portfolio hedge. Coincident with the adoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred HTM mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair value of approximately $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, into AFS as permitted under the guidance, and hedged them under the portfolio layer method.\\n\\nReference Rate Reform\\n\\nOn December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the period of time preparers\\n---\\n## Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Disclosures\\n\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public business entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate reconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by nature and for foreign tax effects by jurisdiction that meet a 5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws or tax credits; effect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include qualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect of the state and local income tax category and explanation of the nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling items. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and by jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative threshold.\\n\\nThe standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2025, and is currently evaluating the impact on disclosures.\\n\\n## Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\\n\\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The ASU was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions.\\n\\nCiti adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company.\\n\\n## Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\n\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, intended to improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and all segments’ profit or loss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis. The amendments also clarified that public entities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.\\n\\nThe ASU is required to be adopted on a retrospective basis and will be effective for Citi for its annual period ending December 31, 2024 and interim periods for the interim period beginning on January 1, 2025. Citi is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its disclosure of reportable segments and related disclosures.\\n---\\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND OTHER BUSINESS EXITS\\n\\nSummary of Discontinued Operations\\n\\nThe Company’s results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to the sales of the Egg Banking plc credit card business in 2011 and the German retail banking business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within All Other.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes financial information for all Discontinued operations:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total revenues, net of interest expense|$ —|$ (260)|$ —|\\n|Income (loss) from discontinued operations|$ (1)|$ (272)|$ 7|\\n|Benefit for income taxes|$ —|$ (41)|$ —|\\n|Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes|$ (1)|$ (231)|$ 7|\\n\\nDuring 2022, the Company finalized the settlement of certain liabilities related to its legacy consumer operation in the U.K. (the legacy operation), including an indemnification liability related to its sale of the Egg Banking business in 2011, which led to the substantial liquidation of the legacy operation. As a result, a CTA loss (net of hedges) in AOCI of approximately $400 million pretax ($345 million after-tax) related to the legacy operation was released to earnings in 2022. Out of the total CTA release, a $260 million pretax loss ($221 million after-tax loss) was attributable to the Egg Banking business noted above, reported in Discontinued operations, and therefore the corresponding CTA release was also reported in Discontinued operations during 2022. The remaining CTA release of a $140 million pretax loss ($124 million after-tax loss) related to Legacy Holdings Assets was reported as part of Continuing operations within All Other—Legacy Franchises.\\n\\nWhile the legacy operation was divested in multiple sales over the years, each transaction did not result in substantial liquidation given that Citi retained certain liabilities noted above, which were gradually settled over time until reaching the point of substantial liquidation during 2022, triggering the release of the CTA loss to earnings.\\n\\nCash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for the periods presented.\\n---\\n## Significant Disposals\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi had closed the sales of nine consumer banking businesses within All Other—Legacy Franchises. Australia closed in the second quarter of 2022, the Philippines closed in the third quarter of 2022, Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, India and Vietnam closed in the first quarter of 2023, Taiwan closed in the third quarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the nine sale agreements, the five below were identified as significant disposals. The gains and losses included in the footnotes to the table below represent life-to-date amounts, which are periodically updated due to post-closing purchase price adjustments. As of December 31, 2023, there were no remaining assets or liabilities included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the significant disposals:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Income (loss) before taxes|\\n|---|---|\\n|Consumer banking business in|Sale agreement date|Closing date|2023|2022|2021|\\n|Australia (1)|8/9/2021|6/1/2022|$—|$193|$306|\\n|Philippines (2)|12/23/2021|8/1/2022|$—|$72|$145|\\n|Thailand (3)|1/14/2022|11/1/2022|$—|$122|$139|\\n|India (4)|3/30/2022|3/1/2023|$2|$194|$213|\\n|Taiwan (5)|1/28/2022|8/12/2023|$91|$140|$282|\\n\\n(1) On June 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Australia consumer banking business, which was part of All Other—Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately $9.4 billion in assets, including $9.3 billion of loans (net of allowance of $140 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $7.3 billion, including $6.8 billion in deposits. The transaction generated a pretax loss on sale of approximately $766 million ($643 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The loss on sale primarily reflected the impact of an approximate pretax $620 million CTA loss (net of hedges) ($470 million after-tax) already reflected in the AOCI component of equity. The sale closed on June 1, 2022, and the CTA-related balance was removed from AOCI, resulting in a neutral CTA impact to Citi’s CET1 Capital. The income before taxes in the above table for Australia reflects Citi’s ownership through June 1, 2022.\\n\\n(2) On August 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Philippines consumer banking business, which was part of All Other—Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately $1.8 billion in assets, including $1.2 billion of loans (net of allowance of $80 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $618 million ($290 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes in the above table for the Philippines reflects Citi’s ownership through August 1, 2022.\\n\\n(3) On November 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Thailand consumer banking business, which was part of All Other—Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately $2.7 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion of loans (net of allowance of $67 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $1.0 billion, including $0.8 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $209 million ($115 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes in the above table for Thailand reflects Citi’s ownership through November 1, 2022.\\n\\n(4) On March 1, 2023, Citi completed the sale of its India consumer banking business, which was part of All Other—Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately $5.2 billion in assets, including $3.4 billion of loans (net of allowance of $32 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $5.2 billion, including $5.1 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $1.1 billion ($727 million after-tax) recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes in the above table for India reflects Citi’s ownership through March 1, 2023.\\n\\n(5) On August 12, 2023, Citi completed the sale of its Taiwan consumer banking business, which was part of All Other—Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately $11.6 billion in assets, including $7.2 billion of loans (net of allowance of $92 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $9.2 billion, including $9.0 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $403 million ($284 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes in the above table for Taiwan reflects Citi’s ownership through August 12, 2023.\\n\\n(6) Income before taxes for the period in which the individually significant component was classified as HFS for all prior periods presented. For Australia, excludes the pretax loss on sale. For the Philippines, Thailand, India and Taiwan, excludes the pretax gain on sale.\\n\\nCiti did not have any other significant disposals as of December 31, 2023. As of February 23, 2024, Citi had not entered into sale agreements for the remaining All Other—Legacy Franchises businesses to be sold, specifically the Poland consumer banking business and the Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses. For a description of the Company’s significant disposal transactions in prior periods and financial impact, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.\\n\\n165\\n---\\n## Other Business Exits\\n\\nWind-Down of Korea Consumer Banking Business\\n\\nOn October 25, 2021, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business, which is reported in the All Other—Legacy Franchises operating segment. In connection with the announcement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) commenced a voluntary early termination program (Korea VERP). Due to the voluntary nature of this termination program, no liabilities for termination benefits are recorded until CKI makes formal offers to employees that are then irrevocably accepted by those employees. Related charges are recorded as Compensation and benefits.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the reserve charges related to the Korea VERP and other initiatives reported in the All Other operating segment:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Employee termination costs|\\n|---|---|\\n|Total Citigroup (pretax)| |\\n|Original charges in fourth quarter 2021|$1,052|\\n|Utilization|(1)|\\n|Foreign exchange|$3|\\n|Balance at December 31, 2021|$1,054|\\n|Additional charges in first quarter 2022|$31|\\n|Utilization|(347)|\\n|Foreign exchange|($24)|\\n|Balance at March 31, 2022|$714|\\n|Additional charges (releases)|($3)|\\n|Utilization|(670)|\\n|Foreign exchange|($41)|\\n|Balance at June 30, 2022|$—|\\n\\nNote: There were no additional charges after June 30, 2022.\\n\\nThe total cash charges for the wind-down were $1.1 billion through 2022, most of which were recognized in 2021. Citi does not expect to record any additional charges in connection with the Korea VERP.\\n\\nSee Note 8 for details on the pension impact of the Korea wind-down.\\n\\nWind-Down of Russia Consumer and Institutional Banking Businesses\\n\\nOn August 25, 2022, Citi announced its decision to wind down its consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in Russia. As part of the wind-down, Citi is also actively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking portfolios.\\n\\nOn October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it would end nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi’s only operations in Russia are those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.\\n\\nWind-Down Charges\\n\\n|2023| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|All Other|Markets and Banking|Total|\\n|Severance (1)|$11|$4|$15|\\n|Vendor termination and other costs (2)|$12|$—|$12|\\n|Total|$23|$4|$27|\\n\\nProgram-to-date December 31, 2023\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|All Other|Markets and Banking|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Severance (1)|$35|$9|$44|\\n|Vendor termination and other costs (2)|$19|$—|$19|\\n|Total|$54|$9|$63|\\n\\nEstimated additional charges as of December 31, 2023\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|All Other|Markets and Banking|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Severance (1)|$20|$2|$22|\\n|Vendor termination and other costs (2)|$36|$—|$36|\\n|Total|$56|$2|$58|\\n\\n(1) Recorded in Compensation and benefits.\\n\\n(2) Recorded in Other operating expenses.\\n---\\n### OPERATING SEGMENTS\\n\\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi changed its management structure resulting in changes in its reportable operating segments to reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance. Citi reorganized its reporting into five reportable operating segments: Services, Markets, Banking, U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) and Wealth, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other, which includes activities not assigned to a specific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued operations.\\n\\n#### Markets\\n\\nMarkets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities.

In most of Citi’s partner sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit losses, which, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given program year, would generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales and new account acquisitions. Interchange revenues are recognized as earned on a daily basis when Citi’s performance obligation to transmit funds to the payment networks has been satisfied. Annual card fees, net of origination costs, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Costs related to card reward programs are recognized when the rewards are earned by the cardholders. Payments to partners are recognized when incurred. Credit card and bank card income is earned primarily by USPB and Services. See Note 3 for segment results.\\n\\n##### Commissions and Fees\\n\\n|Components|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Investment banking fees|Substantially composed of underwriting and advisory revenues. Recognized at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, typically at the closing of a transaction. Reimbursed expenses related to these transactions are recorded as revenue and included within investment banking fees. In certain instances for advisory contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of the deal’s closing. In these instances, the amounts received will be recognized as a liability and not recognized in revenue until the transaction closes. Investment banking fees are earned primarily by Banking and Markets. See Note 3 for segment results.|\\n|Brokerage commissions|Primarily include commissions and fees from executing transactions for clients on exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual funds and other annuity products; and assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and other activities. Recognized in Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. Certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges are recorded net against commission revenue, as the Company is an agent for those services. Sales of certain investment products include a portion of variable consideration associated with the underlying product. In these instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of the product is not recognized until the variable consideration becomes fixed and determinable. Brokerage commissions are earned primarily by Markets and Wealth. See Note 3 for segment results.|\\n|Credit card and bank card income|Primarily composed of interchange fees earned by card issuers based on card spend volumes, and certain card fees, including annual fees. Costs related to customer reward programs and certain payments to partners are recorded as a reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi’s credit card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that vary by partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program.|\\n\\n##### Deposit-related fees\\n\\nConsist of service charges on deposit accounts and fees earned from performing cash management activities and other deposit account services. Such fees are recognized in the period in which the related service is provided. Deposit-related fees are earned primarily by Services and USPB.

Such fees are recognized as/when the associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Transactional service fees are earned primarily by Services. See Note 3 for segment results.\\n\\n##### Insurance distribution revenue\\n\\nConsists of commissions earned from third-party insurance companies for marketing and selling insurance policies on behalf of such entities. Such commissions are recognized in Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally when the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder. Sales of certain insurance products include a portion of variable consideration associated with the underlying product. In these instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of the policy is not recognized until the variable consideration becomes fixed and determinable. The Company recognized $188 million, $201 million, and $260 million of revenue related to such variable consideration for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Insurance distribution revenue is earned primarily by Wealth and Legacy Franchises within All Other.

INCENTIVE PLANS\\n\\nOutstanding (Unvested) Stock Awards\\nA summary of pe status of unvested stock awards granted as discretionary annual incentive or sign-on and replacement stock awards is presented below:\\n\\n### Discretionary Annual Incentive Awards\\n\\nCitigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments and various forms of immediate and deferred awards as part of its discretionary annual incentive award program involving a large segment of Citigroup’s employees worldwide.\\n\\nDiscretionary annual incentive awards are generally awarded in the first quarter of the year based on the previous year’s performance. Awards valued at less than U.S. $75,000 (or the local currency equivalent) are generally paid entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus. Pursuant to Citigroup policy and/or regulatory requirements, certain employees are subject to mandatory deferrals of incentive pay and generally receive 15%–60% of their awards in the form of deferred stock or deferred cash stock units. Discretionary annual incentive awards to certain employees in the EU are subject to deferral requirements regardless of the total award value, with at least 50% of the immediate incentive delivered in the form of a stock payment award subject to a restriction on sale or transfer (generally, for 12 months).\\n\\nFor deferred incentive awards granted in 2022 and after, Citigroup changed the annual deferred compensation structure from granting deferred cash awards for certain regulated employees to deferred stock awards. Certain employees located in countries that have regulations or tax advantages for offering deferred cash or deferred cash stock units received those types of awards as a part of their annual incentive compensation rather than deferred stock.\\n\\nSubject to certain exceptions (principally, for retirement-eligible employees), continuous employment within Citigroup is required to vest in deferred annual incentive awards. Post-employment vesting by retirement-eligible employees and participants who meet other conditions is generally conditioned upon their compliance with certain restrictions during the remaining vesting period.\\n\\n### Performance Share Units\\n\\nCertain senior executives were awarded performance share units (PSUs) every February from 2020 to 2023, for performance in the year prior to the award date based on two performance metrics. For PSUs awarded in 2020, those metrics were return on average tangible common equity and earnings per share. For PSU awards in 2021, 2022 and 2023, the metrics were average return on tangible common equity and cumulative tangible book value per share. In each year, the metrics were equally weighted.\\n\\nFor all award years, if the total shareholder return is negative over the three-year performance period, executives may earn no more than 100% of the target PSUs, regardless of the extent to which Citigroup outperforms against performance goals and/or peer firms. The number of PSUs ultimately earned could vary from zero, if performance goals are not met, to as much as 150% of target, if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded.\\n\\nThe reported financial metrics during the performance period are adjusted to reflect any mandatory equitable adjustments as required under the applicable award agreements for unusual and non-recurring items as presented to and approved by the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture (CPC) Committee.\\n\\nFor all award years, the value of each PSU is equal to the value of one share of Citi common stock. Dividend equivalents are forfeitable, or accrued and paid on the number of earned PSUs after the end of the performance period.\\n---\\n### PSUs\\n\\nPSUs are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with changes in Citigroup’s stock price and the attainment of the specified performance goals for each award. The award is settled solely in cash after the end of each performance period. The value of the award, subject to the performance goals and taking into account any mandatory equitable adjustments as per the terms of the award agreement, is estimated using a simulation model that incorporates multiple valuation assumptions, including the probability of achieving the specified performance goals of each award. The risk-free rate used in the model is based on the applicable U.S. Treasury yield curve. Other significant assumptions for the awards are as follows:\\n\\n|Valuation assumptions|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Expected volatility|35.97%|37.01%|40.88%|\\n|Expected dividend yield|4.13|2.96|4.21|\\n\\n### Stock Option Program\\n\\nAll outstanding options were fully vested at December 31, 2020 and exercised during 2021, with none outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n\\n### Other Variable Incentive Compensation\\n\\nCitigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to motivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of sales, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. Participation in these plans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards. Other forms of variable compensation include commissions paid to financial advisors and mortgage loan officers.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\n\\nExcept for awards subject to variable accounting, the total expense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date fair value of such awards, which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period, other than for awards to retirement-eligible employees and immediately vested awards. Whenever awards are granted or are expected to be granted to retirement-eligible employees, the charge to income is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions for retirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee is retirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested at the grant date, Citi recognizes the expense each year equal to the grant date fair value of the awards that it estimates will be granted in the following year.\\n\\n### Transformation Program\\n\\nIn order to provide an incentive for select employees to effectively execute Citi’s transformation program, in August 2021 the Personnel and Compensation (P&C) Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, the predecessor of the Compensation, Performance Management, and Culture (CPC) Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, approved a program for the select employees to earn additional compensation based on the achievement of Citi’s transformation goals from August 2021 through December 2024 and satisfaction of other conditions. Performance under the program is divided into three consecutive periods, ending on December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The awards are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with the attainment of the performance conditions for each tranche and changes to Citigroup’s stock price for the third tranche.\\n\\n### Performance Share Unit Activity for 2023\\n\\n|Performance share units|Units|Weighted-average grant date fair value per unit|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Outstanding, beginning of year|1,282,135|$76.90|\\n|Granted|1,093,234|$47.15|\\n|Canceled|(332,213)|$84.19|\\n|Payments|-|-|\\n|Outstanding, end of year|2,043,156|$59.79|\\n\\n(1) The weighted-average grant date fair value per unit awarded in 2022 and 2021 was $71.04 and $78.55, respectively.\\n\\n(2) No payments were processed for this program in 2023.\\n\\nPayment for each period will be in cash, in a lump sum, with the third payment indexed to changes in the value of Citi’s common stock from the service inception date through the payment date. Earnings generally will be based on collective performance with respect to Citi’s transformation goals.\\n\\nRecipients of Citigroup stock awards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon vesting. Recipients of stock-settled awards and other vested stock awards subject to a sale-restriction period are generally entitled to vote the shares in their award and receive dividends on such shares during the sale-restriction period. Once a stock award vests, the shares delivered to the participant are freely transferable, unless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period.\\n\\nAll equity awards granted since April 19, 2005 have been made pursuant to stockholder-approved stock incentive plans that are administered by the CPC Committee (or its predecessor), which is composed entirely of independent non-employee directors.\\n\\nOn December 31, 2023, approximately 41.7 million shares of Citigroup common stock were authorized and available for grant under Citigroup’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the only plan from which equity awards are currently granted.\\n---\\n## The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans\\n\\nThe 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans permit the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards granted under the plans. Treasury shares were used to settle vestings from 2018 to 2022, and for the first quarter of 2023, except where local laws favor newly issued shares. The use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards does not affect the compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for equity awards.\\n\\n## Incentive Compensation Cost\\n\\nThe following table presents components of compensation expense, relating to the incentive compensation programs described above:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Charges for estimated awards to retirement-eligible employees|$663|$742|$807|\\n|Amortization of deferred cash awards, deferred cash stock units and performance stock units|$340|$463|$384|\\n|Immediately vested stock award expense|$127|$101|$99|\\n|Amortization of restricted and deferred stock awards|$689|$533|$395|\\n|Other variable incentive compensation|$286|$304|$435|\\n|Total|$2,105|$2,143|$2,091|\\n\\n(1) Represents expense for immediately vested stock awards that generally were stock payments in lieu of cash compensation. The expense is generally accrued as cash incentive compensation in the year prior to grant.\\n\\n(2) All periods include amortization expense for all unvested awards to non-retirement-eligible employees.\\n\\n(3) Citigroup recognized an additional $46 million of share-based compensation costs in 2023 that is reflected in the Restructuring line (not reflected in the above totals). See Note 9.\\n---\\n## RETIREMENT BENEFITS\\n\\nemployees covered under the prior final pay plan formula, the benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years.\\n\\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\\n\\nThe Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the U.S.\\n\\nThe U.S. qualified defined benefit plan was frozen effective January 1, 2008 for most employees. Accordingly, no additional compensation-based contributions have been credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan participants after 2007. However, certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue benefits. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the U.S.\\n\\nThe Company also sponsors a number of non-contributory, nonqualified pension plans. These plans, which are unfunded, provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain U.S. employees. With the exception of certain\\n\\n|Pension plans| | | |U.S. plans| |Non-U.S. plans|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2023| | |2022|2021|2023|2022|2021|\\n|Service cost|$ —|$ —|$ —| |$ 115|$ 116|$ 149|\\n|Interest cost on benefit obligation|$ 505|$ 442|$ 351|$ 409|$ 329|$ 268|\\n|Expected return on assets|$ (640)|$ (612)|$ (683)|$ (327)|$ (263)|$ (253)|\\n|Amortization of:|$ 151|$ 162|$ 228|$ 72|$ 58|$ 62|\\n|Curtailment (gain) loss|$ —|$ —|$ —|$ (16)|$ (22)|$ 1|\\n|Settlement loss (gain)|$ —|$ —|$ —|$ 9|$ (15)|$ 10|\\n|Total net expense (benefit)|$ 18|$ (6)| | |$ (102)|$ 257|$ 196|$ 231|\\n\\n(1) Curtailment and settlement relate to divestiture and wind-down activities.

Total 2022 net expense for non-U.S. plans includes a $36 million net benefit related to the wind-down of Citi’s consumer banking business in Korea.\\n\\n## Contributions\\n\\nThe Company’s funding practice for U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The Company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution, if appropriate. In addition, management has the ability to change its funding practices. For the U.S. pension plans, there were no required minimum cash contributions for 2023 or 2022.\\n\\n|Pension plans|U.S. plans|Non-U.S. plans|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate projected benefit obligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented for all

nonqualified plans’ PBO and ABO exceeded plan assets.\\n\\n## Plan Assumptions\\n\\nThe Company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan obligations and expenses. Changes in one or a combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the Company’s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and (benefit) expense. Changes in the plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\\n\\nThe actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended December 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-end PBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent year (period). Since Citi’s Significant Plans are measured on a quarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans are used to calculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent year’s first quarter.\\n\\nAs a result of the quarterly measurement process, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant Plans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the preceding quarter-end rates (as presented below for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans). The actuarial assumptions for All Other Plans are measured annually.\\n---\\n| |During the year|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Discount rate|U.S. plans| | | |\\n|Qualified pension| |5.50%/5.15%/|2.80%/3.80%/|2.45%/3.10%/|\\n| | |5.40%/6.05%|4.80%/5.65%|2.75%/2.80%|\\n|Nonqualified pension| |5.55/5.20/|2.80/3.85/|2.35/3.00/|\\n| | |5.45/6.10|4.80/5.60|2.70/2.75|\\n|Postretirement benefit plan| |5.60/5.25/|2.75/3.85/|2.20/2.85/|\\n| | |5.50/6.10|4.75/5.65|2.60/2.65|\\n|Non-U.S. pension plans|(1)| | | |\\n|Range (2)| |1.75 to 25.20|-0.10 to 11.95|-0.25 to 11.15|\\n|Weighted average| |6.66|3.96|3.14|\\n|Non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans (1)| | | | |\\n| |Range|3.25 to 11.55|1.05 to 11.25|0.80 to 9.80|\\n|Weighted average|9.80| |8.28|7.42|\\n\\n|Future compensation increase rate|(1)|\\n|---|---|\\n| |Non-U.S. pension plans| | | |\\n|Range|1.30 to 12.40|1.30 to 23.11|1.20 to 11.25|\\n|Weighted average|3.76|3.10|3.10|\\n\\n|Long-term expected return on assets|U.S. plans|\\n|---|---|\\n|Qualified pension (2)|5.70|5.70|\\n|Postretirement benefit plan|5.70/3.00|5.70/3.00|\\n|Non-U.S. pension plans| | | |\\n|Range|2.00 to 11.50|1.00 to 11.50|\\n|Weighted average|6.62|6.05|\\n\\n|Interest crediting rate (weighted average) (3)| |\\n|---|---|\\n|U.S. plans|4.10|4.50|\\n|Non-U.S. plans|1.78|1.73|\\n---\\n## The Company has cash balance plans and other plans with promised\\n\\ninterest crediting rates. For these plans, the interest crediting rates are set used in determining the Company’s pension expense compared to the actual return on assets during 2023, 2022 and 2021 for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans:\\n\\n|U.S. plans (during the year)|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Expected return on assets|U.S. pension and postretirement trust|5.70%|5.00%|5.60%/5.00%|\\n|VEBA Trust (1)|3.00|1.50|1.50|\\n|Actual return on assets (2)|U.S. pension and postretirement trust|9.83|(15.52)|5.14|\\n|VEBA Trust|5.87|1.40|1.52|\\n\\n(1) The expected return on assets for the VEBA Trust was adjusted from 1.50% to 3.00% effective January 1, 2023 to reflect the significant change in economic conditions.\\n\\n(2) Actual return on assets is presented net of fees.\\n\\n## Sensitivities of Certain Key Assumptions\\n\\nThe U.S. Qualified Pension Plan was frozen in 2008, and as a result, most of the prospective service costs have been eliminated and the gain/loss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants. As a result, pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is driven more by interest cost than service cost, and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension expense, while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension expense.\\n\\nFor Non-U.S. Pension Plans that are not frozen (in countries such as Mexico, the U.K. and South Korea), there is more service cost. The pension expense for the Non-U.S. Plans is driven by both service cost and interest cost. An increase in the discount rate generally decreases pension expense due to the greater impact on service cost compared to interest cost.\\n\\n## The following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\\n\\n|Discount rate|One-percentage-point increase|\\n|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|U.S. plans|$22|$27|$35|\\n|Non-U.S. plans|(12)|(5)|(4)|\\n\\n|One-percentage-point decrease|\\n|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|U.S. plans|$(26)|$(34)|$(49)|\\n|Non-U.S. plans|20|15|25|\\n---\\n## Health Care Cost Trend Rate\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|U.S. plans|$(112)|$(123)|$(124)|\\n|Non-U.S. plans|$(54)|$(60)|$(70)|\\n\\nAssumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:\\n\\n| |2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Health care cost increase rate for U.S. plans|6.75%|7.00%|\\n|Ultimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline|5.00|5.00|\\n|Year in which the ultimate rate is reached|2031|2031|\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|U.S. plans|$112|$123|$124|\\n|Non-U.S. plans|$54|$60|$70|\\n\\nHealth care cost increase rate for non-U.S. plans (weighted average)\\n\\n| |2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Following year|7.60%|7.05%|\\n|Ultimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline|7.02|7.05|\\n|Year in which the ultimate rate is reached|2030|2023|\\n\\n## Plan Assets\\n\\nCitigroup’s pension and postretirement benefit plans’ asset allocations for the U.S. plans and the target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows:\\n\\n|Asset category|(1)|2024|2023|2022|2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Equity securities| |0–22%|7%|7%|7%|7%|\\n|Debt securities| |55–105|71|71|71|71|\\n|Real estate| |0–4|2|3|2|3|\\n|Private equity| |0–5|8|7|8|7|\\n|Other investments| |0–23|12|12|12|12|\\n|Total| |100%|100%|100%|100%| |\\n\\n(1) Target asset allocations are set by investment strategy, whereas pension and postretirement assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are based on the underlying investment product. For example, the private equity investment strategy may include underlying investments in real estate within the target asset allocation; however, within pension and postretirement assets, the underlying investment in real estate is reflected in the real estate category and not private equity.\\n\\n(2) Equity securities in the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans do not include any Citigroup common stock at the end of 2023 and 2022.\\n\\n(3) The VEBA Trust for postretirement benefits is primarily invested in cash equivalents and debt securities in 2023 and 2022 and is not reflected in the table above.\\n---\\n## Third-party investment managers and advisors provide their services to Citigroup’s U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. Assets are rebalanced as the Company’s Pension Plan Investment Committee deems appropriate. Citigroup’s investment strategy, with respect to its assets, is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes that, when combined with Citigroup’s contributions to the plans, will maintain the plans’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations.\\n\\n|Asset category|Target asset allocation|Actual range at December 31|Weighted average at December 31|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |2024|2023|2022|2023|2022|2023|2022|\\n|Equity securities| |0–48%|0–48%|0–63%|19%|19%|100%|100%|\\n|Debt securities| |0–100|0–100|0–100|73|73| | |\\n|Real estate| |0–17|0–17|0–15|1|1| | |\\n|Other investments| |0–100|0–100|0–100|7|7| | |\\n\\n|Asset category|Target asset allocation|Actual range at December 31|Weighted average at December 31|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023|2022|2023|2022|2023|2022|\\n|Equity securities|0–46%|0–46%|0–48%|45%|47%|100%|100%|\\n|Debt securities|50–100|49–100|45–100|50|49| | |\\n|Other investments|0–4|0–5|0–7|5|4| | |\\n\\n(1) Similar to the U.S. plans, asset allocations for certain non-U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by investment product.\\n---\\n## Fair Value Disclosure\\n\\nCertain investments may transfer between the fair value.

The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that, when combined with the Company’s contributions to the funds, will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities, fixed income securities and cash and short-term investments. The target asset allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is primarily in equity and debt securities. These allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions. For example, in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments, government funds or local-country securities.\\n\\n### Estimated Future Benefit Payments\\n\\n|Year|Pension plans|Postretirement benefit plans|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |U.S. plans|Non-U.S. plans|U.S. plans|Non-U.S. plans|\\n|2024|$1,000|$638|$57|$89|\\n|2025|$1,005|$558|$41|$93|\\n|2026|$985|$553|$39|$98|\\n|2027|$962|$566|$36|$102|\\n|2028|$937|$569|$34|$107|\\n|2029–2033|$3,974|$3,207|$131|$601|\\n\\n### Post Employment Plans\\n\\nThe Company sponsors U.S. post employment plans that provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible U.S. employees on long-term disability.

The most significant defined contribution plan is the Citi Retirement Savings Plan sponsored by the Company in the U.S.\\n\\nUnder the Citi Retirement Savings Plan, eligible U.S. employees received matching contributions of up to 6% of their eligible compensation for 2023 and 2022, subject to statutory limits. In addition, for eligible employees whose eligible compensation is $100,000 or less, a fixed contribution of up to 2% of eligible compensation is provided. All Company contributions are invested according to participants’ individual elections.\\n\\n### Company Contributions\\n\\n| |U.S. plans|\\n|---|---|\\n|Year|2023|2022|2021|\\n| |Company contributions|$546|$471|$436|\\n\\n| |Non-U.S. plans|\\n|---|---|\\n|Year|2023|2022|2021|\\n| |Company contributions|$453|$399|$364|\\n---\\n## RESTRUCTURING\\n\\nRestructuring charges are recorded as a separate line item within Operating expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. These charges were included within All Other—Corporate/Other.\\n\\nCiti is pursuing various initiatives to simplify the Company and further align its organizational structure with its business strategy. As part of its overall simplification initiatives, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi eliminated the Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking and Wealth Management layers, exited certain institutional business lines, and consolidated its regional structure, creating one international group, while centralizing client capabilities and streamlining its global staff functions.\\n\\nCiti incurred restructuring charges of approximately $780 million in the fourth quarter related to the implementation of its organizational simplification initiatives. These charges included severance costs associated with actual headcount reductions (as well as those headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated), asset write-downs and other costs. Citi expects to incur additional costs related to its organizational simplification in the first quarter of 2024.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Personnel costs|Other|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Beginning balance at January 1, 2023|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Restructuring charge|687|94|781|\\n|Payments and utilization|$—|(69)|(69)|\\n|Foreign exchange|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Ending balance at December 31, 2023|$687|$25|$712|\\n---\\n## 10.

There was an increase of $1.2 billion from the December 31, 2022 balance of $2.4 billion. The amount of Citi’s valuation allowances (VA) may change in future years.\\n\\nIn 2023, Citi’s VA for carry-forward FTCs in its branch basket increased by $1.0 billion, primarily due to lower ODL usage. The level of branch pretax income, the local branch tax rate and the allocations of overall domestic losses (ODL) and expenses for U.S. tax purposes to the branch basket are the main factors in determining the branch VA. There was no branch basket VA release in 2023.\\n\\nThe non-U.S. local VA was unchanged.\\n---\\n|Year of expiration|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|U.S. tax return general basket foreign tax credit carry-forwards (1)|$0.1|$0.8|\\n|2025| | |\\n|2027|$1.1|$1.1|\\n|Total U.S. tax return general basket foreign tax credit carry-forwards|$1.2|$1.9|\\n|U.S. tax return branch basket foreign tax credit carry-forwards (1)| | |\\n|2028|$0.7|$0.7|\\n|2029|$0.2|$0.2|\\n|2033|$1.0|—|\\n|Total U.S. tax return branch basket foreign tax credit carry-forwards|$1.9|$0.9|\\n|U.S. tax return general business credit carry-forwards| | |\\n|2032|$0.4|$0.4|\\n|2033|$0.3|$0.3|\\n|2034|$0.2|$0.2|\\n|2035|$0.2|$0.2|\\n|2036|$0.2|$0.2|\\n|2037|$0.5|$0.5|\\n|2038|$0.5|$0.5|\\n|2039|$0.7|$0.7|\\n|2040|$0.7|$0.7|\\n|2041|$0.8|$0.8|\\n|2042|$0.7|$0.7|\\n|2043|$0.4|—|\\n|Total U.S. tax return general business credit carry-forwards|$5.6|$5.2|\\n|U.S. subsidiary separate federal NOL carry-forwards| | |\\n|2027|$0.1|$0.1|\\n|2028|$0.1|$0.1|\\n|2030|$0.3|$0.3|\\n|2033|$1.7|$1.6|\\n|2034|$1.9|$2.0|\\n|2035|$3.3|$3.3|\\n|2036|$2.1|$2.1|\\n|2037|$1.0|$1.0|\\n|Unlimited carry-forward period|$5.4|$5.3|\\n|Total U.S. subsidiary separate federal NOL carry-forwards (2)|$15.9|$15.8|\\n|New York State NOL carry-forwards (2)| | |\\n|2034|$9.9|$11.5|\\n|New York City NOL carry-forwards (2)| | |\\n|2034|$8.7|$10.3|\\n|Non-U.S. NOL carry-forwards (1)| | |\\n|Various|$1.4|$1.1|\\n---\\n## 11.

Transactions executed by Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity.\\n\\nTo maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.\\n\\nIt is the Company’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.\\n---\\n## The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or master netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, is evidenced to the extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of these agreements and (ii) the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.\\n\\nA legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights.

financial instruments sold to and purchased from brokers, dealers and customers, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Citi is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in question.\\n\\nCiti seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as required.

Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The average external credit rating, disregarding any insurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments.\\n\\nFor AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the difference between the bond’s amortized cost basis and fair value.\\n\\n### Equity Method Investments\\n\\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see Note 26).\\n\\nFor impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date. For impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the following indicators:\\n\\n- the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer;\\n- the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; and\\n- the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value.\\n\\n## Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities\\n\\nCiti records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties.\\n---\\n## Recognition and Measurement of Impairment\\n\\n| |Year ended|\\n|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|Impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company intends to sell, would more-likely-than-not be required to sell or will be subject to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise|$188|$360|$181|\\n\\n## Allowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities\\n\\nThe allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was $8 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n---\\n## Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at Fair Value\\n\\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |Measurement alternative:|Carrying value|$1,639|$1,676|\\n\\nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date amounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Year ended December 31, 2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Measurement alternative:|Impairment losses|$135|$139|\\n| |Downward changes for observable prices|$24|$3|\\n| |Upward changes for observable prices|$87|$177|\\n\\nLife-to-date amounts on securities still held as of December 31, 2023:\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Measurement alternative:|\\n|---|---|\\n|Impairment losses|$338|\\n|Downward changes for observable prices|$34|\\n|Upward changes for observable prices|$951|\\n\\nA similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost.

As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the obligor, qualitative assessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of repayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee arrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography.\\n\\nThe obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms, which are the product of the probability of default and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as defined by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified according to the bank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the non-investment-grade categories.\\n---\\n## Corporate Loans Credit Quality Indicators\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Term loans by year of origination|Revolving line of credit arrangements|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|\\n|Investment grade|Commercial and industrial|$47,811|$7,738|$3,641|$2,279|$2,604|$6,907|$34,956|$105,936|\\n| |Financial institutions|$11,002|$2,356|$2,834|$424|$557|$1,847|$36,715|$55,735|\\n| |Mortgage and real estate|$3,628|$4,433|$3,595|$2,544|$1,238|$1,582|$66|$17,086|\\n| |Other|$4,653|$5,781|$1,072|$1,029|$812|$5,302|$29,335|$47,984|\\n|Total investment grade| |$67,094|$20,308|$11,142|$6,276|$5,211|$15,638|$101,072|$226,741|\\n|Non-investment grade|Accrual|$17,570|$4,785|$1,914|$1,359|$732|$2,526|$15,912|$44,798|\\n| |Financial institutions|$4,207|$748|$1,084|$56|$194|$260|$2,725|$9,274|\\n| |Mortgage and real estate|$1,034|$1,234|$1,378|$947|$755|$1,016|$620|$6,984|\\n| |Other|$653|$434|$248|$158|$211|$155|$1,253|$3,112|\\n| |Non-accrual|$53|$46|$84|$35|$45|$93|$361|$717|\\n| |Financial institutions|$-|$-|$-|$-|$-|$-|$51|$51|\\n| |Mortgage and real estate|$118|$233|$8|$38|$110|$308|$53|$868|\\n| |Other|$8|$-|$41|$-|$55|$12|$130|$246|\\n|Total non-investment grade| |$23,643|$7,480|$4,757|$2,593|$2,102|$4,370|$21,105|$66,050|\\n|Loans at fair value| |$7,281| |\\n\\nCorporate loans, net of unearned income\\n\\n$90,737\\n$27,788\\n$15,899\\n$8,869\\n$7,313\\n$20,008\\n$122,177\\n$300,072\\n---\\n## Recorded investment in loans\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|Prior|Arrangements|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | |Term loans by year of origination| |Revolving line of credit|(2)|December 31, 2022| |\\n|Investment grade|(3)| | | | | | | | |\\n|Commercial and industrial|$40,639|$6,124|$3,620|$3,458|$2,617|$7,048|$38,358|$101,864|\\n|Financial institutions|$11,850|$3,877|$835|$922|$333|$1,327|$37,462|$56,606|\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$4,436|$3,236|$4,010|$2,619|$1,127|$1,706|$152|$17,286|\\n|Other|$7,649|$2,687|$1,439|$643|$2,119|$3,832|$26,805|$45,174|\\n|Total investment grade|$64,574|$15,924|$9,904|$7,642|$6,196|$13,913|$102,777|$220,930|\\n|Non-investment grade|(3)| | | | | | | |\\n|Accrual| | | | | | | | |\\n|Commercial and industrial|$17,278|$3,139|$1,973|$1,331|$965|$3,546|$16,848|$45,080|\\n|Financial institutions|$4,708|$630|$197|$254|$47|$240|$2,073|$8,149|\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$582|$835|$429|$729|$783|$801|$472|$4,631|\\n|Other|$1,244|$559|$391|$413|$1|$219|$1,292|$4,119|\\n|Non-accrual| | | | | | | | |\\n|Commercial and industrial|$1|$12|$99|$115|$49|$105|$479|$860|\\n|Financial institutions|$41|$34|$—|$—|$—|$—|$77|$152|\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$10|$4|$—|$—|$—|$19|$—|$33|\\n|Other|$6|$—|$26|$8|$10|$11|$16|$77|\\n|Total non-investment grade|$23,870|$5,213|$3,115|$2,850|$1,855|$4,941|$21,257|$63,101|\\n|Loans at fair value| |$5,123| | | | | | |\\n|Corporate loans, net of unearned income|$88,444|$21,137|$13,019|$10,492|$8,051|$18,854|$124,034|$289,154|\\n\\n(1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.\\n\\n(2) There were no significant revolving line of credit arrangements that converted to term loans during the year.\\n\\n(3) Held-for-investment loans are accounted for on an amortized cost basis.\\n\\n(4) Includes certain short-term loans with less than one year in tenor.\\n\\n(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.\\n\\n(6) Loans at fair value include loans to commercial and industrial, financial institutions, mortgage and real estate and other.\\n\\n(7) Excludes $93 million of unallocated portfolio layer cumulative basis adjustments at December 31, 2023.\\n\\nCollateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral with no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying value or collateral value, less cost to sell.

Each modification is unique to the borrower’s individual circumstances. The following table details corporate loan modifications granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications. Citi defines a corporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of a loan classified as substandard or worse at the time of modification.\\n\\n214\\n---\\n## For the year ended December 31, 2023\\n\\n|Total modifications|Combination: term extension|Weighted-average term extension (months)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars, except for weighted-average term extension|balance at December 31, 2023 (1)(2)(3)| |\\n|Commercial and industrial|$198|18|19|\\n|Financial institutions| | | |\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$144|1|24|\\n|Other (5)| | | |\\n|Total|$342|19| |\\n\\n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period. The balances are not significant as a percentage of the total carrying values of loans by class of receivable as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n(2) Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n(3) The allowance for corporate loans, including modified loans, is based on the borrower’s overall financial performance. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the modification or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.\\n\\n(4) Payment delays either for principal or interest payments had an immaterial financial impact.\\n\\n(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.\\n\\n## The following table presents the Company’s corporate troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), under previous GAAP, prior to the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 on January 1, 2023:\\n\\n|Carrying value of TDRs modified during the year|TDRs involving changes in the amount and/or timing of principal payments (1)|TDRs involving changes in the amount and/or timing of interest payments (2)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars| | |\\n|Commercial and industrial|$61|$—|$—|\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$2|$1|$—|\\n|Other (3)|$30|$—|$—|\\n|Total|$93|$1|$—|\\n\\n(1) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.\\n\\n(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.\\n\\n(3) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.\\n\\n## Performance of Modified Corporate Loans\\n\\n| |Total|Current|30–89 days (1)|90+ days|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars| | | | |\\n|Commercial and industrial|$198|$198|$—|$—|\\n|Financial institutions|$—|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$144|$144|$—|$—|\\n|Other (2)|$—|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Total|$342|$342|$—|$—|\\n\\n(1) Corporate loans are generally not modified as a result of their delinquency status; rather, they are modified because of events that have impacted the overall financial performance of the borrower. Corporate loans, if past due, are re-aged to current status upon modification.\\n\\n(2) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.\\n---\\n## Defaults of Modified Corporate Loans\\n\\nNo modified corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2023. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due. For a modified corporate loan that is not collateral dependent, expected default rates are considered in the loan’s individually assessed ACL.\\n\\n| |TDR balances at December 31, 2022|TDR loans that re-defaulted in 2022 within one year of modification|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Commercial and industrial|$85|—|\\n|Mortgage and real estate|$13|—|\\n|Other (1)|$12|—|\\n|Total (2)|$110|—|\\n\\n(1) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.\\n\\n(2) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that were considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\\n\\n## Consumer Loans\\n\\nConsumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by USPB, Wealth and All Other—Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM). Citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency status, consumer credit scores under Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, each as discussed in more detail below.\\n\\n### Delinquency Status\\n\\nDelinquency status is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date.\\n\\nAs a general policy, residential first mortgages, home equity loans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due. Credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days past due. Home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration (FHA)–insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.\\n\\nThe policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to current status varies by product. Generally, one of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years).\\n\\nFurthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to re-age a modified loan to current.\\n\\nThe tables below present details about these loans, including the following loan categories:\\n\\n- Residential first mortgages and Home equity loans primarily represent secured mortgage lending to customers of Retail Banking and Wealth.\\n- Credit cards primarily represent unsecured credit card lending to customers of Branded Cards and Retail Services.\\n- Personal, small business and other loans are primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to customers of Wealth (mainly within the Private Bank) who are typically high credit quality borrowers that historically experienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. Loans to these borrowers are generally well collateralized in the form of liquid securities and other forms of collateral.\\n---\\n## Consumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December 31, 2023\\n\\n| |30–89 days past due|>= 90 days past due|Past due government guaranteed|Total|Non-accrual loans for which there is no ACLL|Non-accrual loans for which there is an ACLL|Total non-accrual|Past due and accruing|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|current|(1)(2)|due (3)|due (3)|loans|ACLL|ACLL|accrual|and accruing|\\n|In North America offices (5)|Residential first mortgages (6)|$107,720|$462|$294|$235|$108,711|$105|$384|$489|$120|\\n| |Home equity loans (7)(8)|$3,471|$36|$85|$0|$3,592|$48|$126|$174|$0|\\n| |Credit cards|$159,966|$2,293|$2,461|$0|$164,720|$0|$0|$0|$2,461|\\n| |Personal, small business and other (9)|$35,970|$104|$57|$4|$36,135|$6|$59|$65|$5|\\n|Total|$307,127|$2,895|$2,897|$239|$313,158|$159|$569|$728|$2,586|\\n\\n|In offices outside North America (5)|Residential mortgages (6)|$26,309|$48|$69|$0|$26,426|$0|$243|$243|$0|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Credit cards|$13,797|$209|$227|$0|$14,233|$0|$211|$211|$88|\\n| |Personal, small business and other (9)|$35,233|$107|$40|$0|$35,380|$0|$133|$133|$0|\\n|Total|$75,339|$364|$336|$0|$76,039|$0|$587|$587|$88| |\\n\\nTotal Citigroup (10)(11)\\n$382,466\\n$3,259\\n$3,233\\n$239\\n$389,197\\n$159\\n$1,156\\n$1,315\\n$2,674\\n\\n## Consumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December 31, 2022\\n\\n| |30–89 days past due|>= 90 days past due|Past due government guaranteed|Total|Non-accrual loans for which there is no ACLL|Non-accrual loans for which there is an ACLL|Total non-accrual|Past due and accruing|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|current|(1)(2)|due (3)|due (3)|loans|ACLL|ACLL|accrual|and accruing|\\n|In North America offices (5)|Residential first mortgages (6)|$95,023|$421|$316|$279|$96,039|$86|$434|$520|$163|\\n| |Home equity loans (7)(8)|$4,407|$38|$135|$0|$4,580|$51|$151|$202|$0|\\n| |Credit cards|$147,717|$1,511|$1,415|$0|$150,643|$0|$0|$0|$1,415|\\n| |Personal, small business and other (9)|$37,635|$88|$22|$7|$37,752|$3|$23|$26|$11|\\n|Total|$284,782|$2,058|$1,888|$286|$289,014|$140|$608|$748|$1,589|\\n\\n|In offices outside North America (5)|Residential mortgages (6)|$27,946|$62|$106|$0|$28,114|$0|$305|$305|$13|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Credit cards|$12,659|$147|$149|$0|$12,955|$0|$127|$127|$56|\\n| |Personal, small business and other (9)|$37,869|$105|$10|$0|$37,984|$0|$137|$137|$0|\\n|Total|$78,474|$314|$265|$0|$79,053|$0|$569|$569|$69| |\\n\\nTotal Citigroup (10)(11)\\n$363,256\\n$2,372\\n$2,153\\n$286\\n$368,067\\n$140\\n$1,177\\n$1,317\\n$1,658\\n\\n(1) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\\n\\n(2) Includes $313 million and $237 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of residential first mortgages recorded at fair value.\\n\\n(3) Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies.

The increase was largely due to the reclassification of a mortgage portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 that was subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023. The Company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Loans held by a business for sale are not included in the above since they have been reclassified to Other assets. See Note 2 for additional information regarding Citigroup’s businesses held-for-sale.\\n---\\n## Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)\\n\\nWith respect to Citi’s consumer loan portfolio outside of the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual’s risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history and assign every consumer a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score. These scores are continually updated by the agencies based on an individual’s credit actions (e.g., taking out a loan or missed or late payments).\\n\\nThe following tables provide details on the FICO scores for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become available.\\n\\n**FICO score distribution—U.S. portfolio (1) December 31, 2023**\\n|In millions of dollars|Less than 680|680 to 760|Greater than 760|Classifiably (2)|FICO not available (3)|Total loans|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Residential first mortgages|$373|$5,396|$11,461| |$7,763|$108,711|\\n|Home equity line of credit (pre-reset)|$425|$1,174|$1,479| |$5|$3,592|\\n|Home equity line of credit (post-reset)| |$79|$75|$52| | |\\n|Home equity term loans| |$80|$124|$99| | |\\n|Credit cards|$32,500|$63,334|$64,712| |$1,955|$164,110|\\n|Revolving loans converted to term loans (4)| |$1,154|$401|$54| | |\\n|Personal, small business and other|$138|$438|$851|$29,209|$2,739|$35,258|\\n|Total|$39,065|$95,566|$135,369|$29,209|$12,462|$311,671|\\n---\\n## FICO score distribution—U.S. portfolio (1) December 31, 2022\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Less than 680|680 to 760|Greater than 760|Classifiably managed (2)|FICO not available (3)|Total loans|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Residential first mortgages| | | | | | |\\n|2022|$691|$7,530|$12,928| | | |\\n|2021|$639|$5,933|$12,672| | | |\\n|2020|$431|$4,621|$10,936| | | |\\n|2019|$321|$2,505|$5,445| | | |\\n|2018|$302|$1,072|$1,899| | | |\\n|Prior|$2,020|$6,551|$12,649| | | |\\n|Total residential first mortgages|$4,404|$28,212|$56,529|$6,894|$96,039| |\\n|Home equity line of credit (pre-reset)|$552|$1,536|$1,876| | | |\\n|Home equity line of credit (post-reset)| |$62|$65|$40| | |\\n|Home equity term loans| |$106|$151|$117| | |\\n|2022| | | | | | |\\n|2021| |$1|$1| | | |\\n|2020|$1|$2|$2| | | |\\n|2019|$1|$2|$2| | | |\\n|2018|$1|$2|$1| | | |\\n|Prior|$103|$144|$111| | | |\\n|Total home equity loans|$720|$1,752|$2,033|$75|$4,580| |\\n|Credit cards|$27,901|$58,213|$60,896| | | |\\n|Revolving loans converted to term loans (4)| |$766|$354|$54| | |\\n|Total credit cards (5)|$28,667|$58,567|$60,950|$1,914|$150,098| |\\n|Personal, small business and other| | | | | | |\\n|2022|$247|$546|$800| | | |\\n|2021|$96|$170|$210| | | |\\n|2020|$15|$20|$30| | | |\\n|2019|$21|$23|$28| | | |\\n|2018|$10|$10|$9| | | |\\n|Prior|$126|$190|$144| | | |\\n|Total personal, small business and other (6)(7)|$515|$959|$1,221|$31,478|$2,639|$36,812|\\n|Total|$34,306|$89,490|$120,733|$31,478|$11,522|$287,529|\\n\\n(1) The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer presentations.\\n\\n(2) These personal, small business and other loans without a FICO score available include $29.2 billion and $31.5 billion of Private Bank loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are classifiably managed within Wealth and are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk ratings.

Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi’s significant consumer modification programs are described below.\\n\\n### Residential Mortgages\\n\\nCiti utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower’s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $21 million of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. Mortgage loans of $7 million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\n### Credit Cards\\n\\nCiti seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer’s available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers’ entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi’s standard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount.\\n---\\n## Types of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect\\n\\n| |Total modifications|Combination: interest rate reduction and term extension|Combination: payment delay and term extension|Weighted-average interest rate reduction|Weighted-average term extension|Weighted-average delay in payments (months)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars, except weighted averages|Modifications as % of loans|Balance at December 31, 2023 (1)(2)(3)|Interest rate reduction|Term extension|Payment delay|Extension and delay|Extension and delay %|Interest rate reduction %|Term extension (months)|Delay in payments (months)|\\n|In North America offices (4)| | | | | | |\\n|Residential first mortgages (5)|0.15 %|$164|$3|$63|$89|$9|-|1 %|202|9|\\n|Home equity loans|0.58|$21|-|-|$9|$12|-|2|121|9|\\n|Credit cards|0.63|$1,039|$1,039|-|-|-|-|23|-|-|\\n|Personal, small business and other|0.04|$14|$2|-|-|$12|-|6|15|-|\\n|Total (4)|0.40 %|$1,238|$1,044|$63|$98|$33|-|\\n|In offices outside North America| | | | | | |\\n|Residential mortgages|1.26 %|$334|-|-|$33|$2|$299|2 %|4|4|\\n|Credit cards|0.30|$43|$42|-|-|$1|-|18|37|-|\\n|Personal, small business and other|0.08|$27|$5|$7|-|$15|-|7|19|-|\\n|Total|0.53 %|$404|$47|$7|$33|$18|$299|\\n\\n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period.

The increase in the ACLL was primarily driven by card balances in Branded Cards and Retail Services and an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by a decrease in the ACLL of $352 million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs (see Note 1) and improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts.\\n\\n### ACLUC\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi’s total ACLUC, included in Other liabilities, was $1,728 million, a decrease from $2,151 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook.\\n\\n### Consumer ACLL\\n\\nCiti’s total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) as of December 31, 2023 was $15,431 million, an increase from $14,119 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by growth in U.S. cards balances, partially offset by a decrease to the ACLL of $352 million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs.\\n---\\n## Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and End-of-Period Loans at December 31, 2022\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Corporate|Consumer|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|ACLL at beginning of year|$2,415|$14,040|$16,455|\\n|Gross credit losses on loans|(278)|(4,878)|(5,156)|\\n|Gross recoveries on loans|100|1,267|1,367|\\n|Replenishment of NCLs|178|3,611|3,789|\\n|Net reserve builds (releases)|374|563|937|\\n|Net specific reserve builds (releases)|65|(46)|19|\\n|Other|1|(438)|(437)|\\n|Ending balance|$2,855|$14,119|$16,974|\\n\\n|ACLL|\\n|---|\\n|Collectively evaluated|$2,532|$13,521|$16,053|\\n|Individually evaluated|323|596|919|\\n|Purchased credit deteriorated|-|2|2|\\n|Total ACLL|$2,855|$14,119|$16,974|\\n\\n|Loans, net of unearned income|\\n|---|\\n|Collectively evaluated|$282,909|$364,795|$647,704|\\n|Individually evaluated|1,122|2,921|4,043|\\n|Purchased credit deteriorated|-|114|114|\\n|Held at fair value|5,123|237|5,360|\\n|Total loans, net of unearned income|$289,154|$368,067|$657,221|\\n\\n## Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans at December 31, 2021\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Corporate|Consumer|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|ACLL at beginning of year|$4,776|$20,180|$24,956|\\n|Gross credit losses on loans|(500)|(6,220)|(6,720)|\\n|Gross recoveries on loans|114|1,711|1,825|\\n|Replenishment of NCLs|386|4,509|4,895|\\n|Net reserve builds (releases)|(2,075)|(5,208)|(7,283)|\\n|Net specific reserve builds (releases)|(255)|(460)|(715)|\\n|Other|(31)|(472)|(503)|\\n|Ending balance|$2,415|$14,040|$16,455|\\n\\n## Allowance for Credit Losses on HTM Debt Securities\\n\\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM debt securities, which the Company has the intent and ability to hold, was $95 million, $120 million and $87 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n---\\n## Allowance for Credit Losses on Other Assets\\n\\n| |Year ended December 31, 2023| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|Deposits with banks|Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements|All other assets (1)|Total|\\n|Allowance for credit losses on other assets at beginning of year|$51|$36|$36|$123|\\n|Gross credit losses|—|—|($97)|($97)|\\n|Gross recoveries|—|—|$25|$25|\\n|Net credit losses (NCLs)|$—|$—|($72)|($72)|\\n|Replenishment of NCLs|$—|$—|$72|$72|\\n|Net reserve builds (releases)|($19)|$14|$1,695|$1,690|\\n|Total provision for credit losses|($19)|$14|$1,767|$1,762|\\n|Other, net|($1)|($23)|($1)|($25)|\\n|Allowance for credit losses on other assets at end of year|$31|$27|$1,730|$1,788|\\n\\n(1) Primarily ACL related to transfer risk associated with exposures outside of the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.\\n\\n| |Year ended December 31, 2022| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|Deposits with banks|Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements|All other assets (1)|Total|\\n|Allowance for credit losses on other assets at beginning of year|$21|$6|$26|$53|\\n|Gross credit losses|—|—|($24)|($24)|\\n|Gross recoveries|—|—|$3|$3|\\n|Net credit losses (NCLs)|$—|$—|($21)|($21)|\\n|Replenishment of NCLs|$—|$—|$21|$21|\\n|Net reserve builds (releases)|$30|$14|$11|$55|\\n|Total provision for credit losses|$30|$14|$32|$76|\\n|Other, net (2)|$—|$16|($1)|$15|\\n|Allowance for credit losses on other assets at end of year|$51|$36|$36|$123|\\n\\n(1) Primarily accounts receivable.\\n\\n(2) Includes $30 million of ACL transferred from Services, Markets and Banking loans ACL during the second quarter of 2022 for securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell.\\n\\n| |Year ended December 31, 2021| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|Deposits with banks|Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements|All other assets (1)|Total|\\n|Allowance for credit losses on other assets at beginning of year|$20|$10|$25|$55|\\n|Gross credit losses|—|—|($2)|($2)|\\n|Gross recoveries|—|—|—|—|\\n|Net credit losses (NCLs)|$—|$—|($2)|($2)|\\n|Replenishment of NCLs|$—|$—|$2|$2|\\n|Net reserve builds (releases)|$2|($4)|—|($2)|\\n|Total provision for credit losses|$2|($4)|$2|—|\\n|Other, net|($1)|—|$1|—|\\n|Allowance for credit losses on other assets at end of year|$21|$6|$26|$53|\\n\\n(1) Primarily accounts receivable.\\n\\nFor ACL on AFS debt securities, see Note 14.\\n---\\n## 17.

Consistent with the requirements of ASC 350, additional interim goodwill impairment tests were performed as of December 13, 2023, which resulted in no impairment during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, goodwill was reallocated from Banking to Markets related to the business realignment based on their relative fair values using the valuation performed as of the effective date of the reorganization. No additional triggering events were identified and no goodwill was impaired during 2023.\\n\\nFor additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill impairment testing process, see Note 1 for Citi’s accounting policy for goodwill and Note 3 for a description of Citi’s operating segments.\\n\\n233\\n---\\n## Intangible Assets\\n\\n| |Gross carrying amount|December 31, 2023|Net carrying amount|Gross carrying amount|December 31, 2022|Net carrying amount|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Purchased credit card relationships (1)|$5,302|$4,365|$937|$5,513|$4,426|$1,087|\\n|Credit card contract-related intangibles (2)|$4,177|$1,698|$2,479|$3,903|$1,518|$2,385|\\n|Other customer relationships|$363|$290|$73|$373|$283|$90|\\n|Present value of future profits|$37|$36|$1|$32|$31|$1|\\n|Indefinite-lived intangible assets|$240|—|$240|$192|—|$192|\\n|Other|—|—|—|$65|$57|$8|\\n\\nIntangible assets (excluding MSRs):\\n\\n| |Gross carrying amount|Accumulated amortization|Net carrying amount|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |$10,119|$6,389|$3,730|\\n\\nMortgage servicing rights (MSRs):\\n\\n| |Gross carrying amount|Net carrying amount|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|(3)|$691|$691|\\n\\nTotal intangible assets:\\n\\n| |Gross carrying amount|Net carrying amount|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |$10,810|$4,421|\\n\\nIntangible assets amortization expense:\\n\\n$370 million, $352 million, and $360 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year were to exceed amounts specified by the agency’s regulations.\\n\\nIn determining the dividends, each subsidiary depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal bank regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

Investors that finance the VIE through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support, such as guarantees, certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity.\\n\\n## Uses of Special Purpose Entities\\n\\nA special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs by Citi are to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and create investment products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital efficiency by securitizing certain of Citi’s financial assets. SPEs may be organized in various legal forms, including trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, through the SPE’s issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness, the company transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business. These issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the SPE.\\n\\nInvestors usually have recourse only to the assets in the SPE, but may also benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances. This results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE.

In general, the third-party investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing.\\n\\nIntercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about these Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.\\n\\n## Significant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs—Balance Sheet Classification\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Cash|$—|$—|\\n|Trading account assets|1.9|1.6|\\n|Investments|8.3|8.6|\\n|Total loans, net of allowance|51.8|44.2|\\n|Other|0.6|0.6|\\n|Total assets|$62.6|$55.0|\\n---\\n## Credit Card Securitizations\\n\\nThe Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations: as customers pay their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust.\\n\\nThe Company’s primary credit card securitization activity is through two trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority through the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities because, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables remain on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss recognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\n**Amounts related to the Company’s securitized credit card receivables:**\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables Sold to investors via trust-issued securities|$6.9|$7.9|\\n|Ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables Retained by Citigroup as trust-issued securities|$5.1|$6.4|\\n|Ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables Retained by Citigroup via non-certificated interests|$21.4|$19.5|\\n|Total|$33.4|$33.8|\\n\\n**Selected cash flow information related to Citigroup’s credit card securitizations:**\\n| |2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Proceeds from new securitizations|$1.5|$0.3|—|\\n|Pay down of maturing notes|($2.4)|($2.1)|($6.0)|\\n\\n### Managed Loans\\n\\nAfter securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages. As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all managed securitized card receivables are on-balance sheet.\\n\\nFunding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinated Interests\\n\\nAs noted above, Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two securitization trusts—Master Trust and Omni Trust. The liabilities of the trusts are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, excluding those retained by Citigroup.\\n\\n**Master Trust Liabilities (at Par Value)**\\n| |Dec. 31, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Term notes issued to third parties|$5.4|$6.3|\\n|Term notes retained by Citigroup affiliates|$1.5|$1.6|\\n|Total Master Trust liabilities|$6.9|$7.9|\\n\\n**Omni Trust Liabilities (at Par Value)**\\n| |Dec. 31, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Term notes issued to third parties|$1.5|$1.6|\\n|Term notes retained by Citigroup affiliates|$3.6|$4.8|\\n|Total Omni Trust liabilities|$5.1|$6.4|\\n---\\n## Mortgage Securitizations\\n\\nCitigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base. Once originated, the Company often securitizes these loans through the use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi’s credit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust.\\n\\nCiti’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of Services, Markets and Banking securitizations. Citi’s Services, Markets and Banking businesses may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in connection with secondary market-making activities.\\n\\nThe Company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a U.S. government-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, a U.S. agency-sponsored entity, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or a private label (non-agency-sponsored) securitization.\\n\\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage securitizations:\\n\\n| |U.S. agency-sponsored 2023|Non-agency-sponsored 2023|U.S. agency-sponsored 2022|Non-agency-sponsored 2022|U.S. agency-sponsored 2021|Non-agency-sponsored 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Principal securitized|$4.9|$4.8|$6.9|$13.9|$6.1|$25.2|\\n|Proceeds from new securitizations|$4.9|$3.5|$6.7|$13.4|$6.4|$25.4|\\n|Contractual servicing fees received|$0.1|—|$0.1|—|$0.1|—|\\n|Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows|—|$0.2|—|$0.2|—|$0.1|\\n|Purchases of previously transferred financial assets|—|—|$0.1|—|$0.2|—|\\n\\nNote: Excludes re-securitization transactions.\\n\\nFor non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the transfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale accounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets and the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial interests or servicing rights).\\n\\nAgency and non-agency securitization gains for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $0.4 million and $88.7 million, respectively.\\n\\nAgency and non-agency securitization gains for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $1.3 million and $154.8 million, respectively, and $3.9 million and $493.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n\\n| |2023 Non-agency-sponsored|2022 Non-agency-sponsored|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|\\n| |Senior interests|Senior interests|\\n| |Subordinated interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|Carrying value of retained interests|$689|$659|\\n| |$943|$1,119|\\n| |$963|$943|\\n---\\n## Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization.\\n\\nSenior interests in non-agency-sponsored mortgages include $0.9 million related to personal loan securitizations at December 31, 2023.\\n\\nRetained interests consist of Level 2 and Level 3 assets depending on the observability of significant inputs. See Note 26 for more information about fair value measurements.\\n\\n### Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|Non-agency-sponsored mortgages| |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|Senior interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|Weighted-average discount rate|12.9 %|6.0 %|6.1 %|\\n|Weighted-average constant prepayment rate|5.9 %|8.6 %|7.3 %|\\n|Weighted-average anticipated net credit losses (2)|NM|0.2 %|0.9 %|\\n|Weighted-average life|7.7 years|6.8 years|8.1 years|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2022|Non-agency-sponsored mortgages| |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|Senior interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|Weighted-average discount rate|8.8 %|3.2 %|4.1 %|\\n|Weighted-average constant prepayment rate|2.7 %|6.0 %|11.4 %|\\n|Weighted-average anticipated net credit losses (2)|NM|2.0 %|0.4 %|\\n|Weighted-average life|9.0 years|5.5 years|5.6 years|\\n\\n(1) Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization.\\n\\n(2) Anticipated net credit losses represent estimated loss severity associated with defaulted mortgage loans underlying the mortgage securitizations disclosed above. Anticipated net credit losses, in this instance, do not represent total credit losses incurred to date, nor do they represent credit losses expected on retained interests in mortgage securitizations. NM Anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to U.S. agency guarantees.\\n\\nThe interests retained by the Company range from highly rated and/or senior in the capital structure to unrated and/or residual interests. Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests in securitizations of mortgage receivables at period end were as follows:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|Non-agency-sponsored mortgages| |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|Senior interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|Weighted-average discount rate|5.4 %|NM|NM|\\n|Weighted-average constant prepayment rate|5.8 %|NM|NM|\\n|Weighted-average anticipated net credit losses (2)|NM|NM|NM|\\n|Weighted-average life|7.5 years|NM|NM|\\n\\n| |December 31, 2022|Non-agency-sponsored mortgages| |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|Senior interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|Weighted-average discount rate|5.3 %|13.8 %|NM|\\n|Weighted-average constant prepayment rate (2)|5.8 %|4.0 %|NM|\\n|Weighted-average anticipated net credit losses|NM|1.0 %|NM|\\n|Weighted-average life|7.7 years|10.3 years|NM|\\n\\n(1) Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization.\\n---\\n## Anticipated Net Credit Losses\\n\\nAnticipated net credit losses represent estimated loss severity associated with defaulted mortgage loans underlying the mortgage securitizations disclosed above.

NM Anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to U.S. agency guarantees.\\n\\n## Sensitivity Analysis\\n\\nThe sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions is presented in the tables below. The negative effect of each change is calculated independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key assumptions may not be independent, the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects presented below.\\n\\n**December 31, 2023**\\n| |Non-agency-sponsored mortgages|U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|Senior interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Discount rate|Adverse change of 10%|$(20)|—|—|\\n| |Adverse change of 20%|$(40)|—|—|\\n|Constant prepayment rate|Adverse change of 10%|$(17)|—|—|\\n| |Adverse change of 20%|$(34)|—|—|\\n|Anticipated net credit losses|Adverse change of 10%|NM|—|—|\\n| |Adverse change of 20%|NM|—|—|\\n\\n**December 31, 2022**\\n| |Non-agency-sponsored mortgages|U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages|Senior interests|Subordinated interests|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Discount rate|Adverse change of 10%|$(19)|—|—|\\n| |Adverse change of 20%|$(37)|—|—|\\n|Constant prepayment rate|Adverse change of 10%|$(15)|—|—|\\n| |Adverse change of 20%|$(30)|—|—|\\n|Anticipated net credit losses|Adverse change of 10%|NM|—|—|\\n| |Adverse change of 20%|NM|—|—|\\n\\nNM Anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to U.S. agency guarantees.\\n\\n## Loan Delinquencies and Liquidation Losses\\n\\nThe following table includes information about loan delinquencies and liquidation losses for assets held in non-consolidated, non-agency-sponsored securitization entities at December 31:\\n\\n| |Securitized assets|90 days past due|Liquidation losses|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2023|2022|2023|2022|2023|2022|\\n|Residential mortgages|$28.2|$30.8|$0.5|$0.5|$4.3|$2.9|\\n|Commercial and other|$29.9|$28.8|—|—|—|—|\\n|Total|$58.1|$59.6|$0.5|$0.5|$4.3|$2.9|\\n\\n(1) Securitized assets include $117 million of personal loan securitizations as of December 31, 2023.\\n---\\n## Consumer Loan Securitizations\\n\\nThe Company receives fees during the course of servicing. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Citi relaunched a program securitizing other consumer loans into asset-backed securities. The principal securitized and the proceeds from new securitizations for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. The gain recognized on the securitization of consumer loans was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\n### Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\\n\\nIn connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees.\\n\\nThese transactions create intangible assets referred to as MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of Citi’s capitalized MSRs was $691 million and $665 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $52 billion and $51 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Servicing fees|$129|$122|$131|\\n|Late fees|4|4|3|\\n|Total MSR fees|$133|$126|$134|\\n\\n### Re-securitizations\\n\\nThe Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Citi held no retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.\\n\\nThe Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $17.1 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively, to re-securitization entities.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Balance, beginning of year|$665|$404|\\n|Originations|66|120|\\n|Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions|28|201|\\n|Other changes (1)|-68|-60|\\n|Balance, as of December 31|$691|$665|\\n\\n(1) Represents changes due to customer payments.\\n\\nThe fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets.\\n---\\nCiti-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits\\n\\nThe Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties.\\n\\nCiti’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the Company’s clients access to low-cost funding in the commercial paper markets. The conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by Citi. The funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the Company.\\n\\nAs administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the Company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit, which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients. Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size.\\n\\nThe conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $21.1 billion and $19.6 billion of purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $16.7 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively.\\n\\nSubstantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 68 and 64 days, respectively.\\n\\nThe primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit enhancements described above. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancements, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees.\\n\\nCredit enhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $200 million to $350 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The net result across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.\\n\\nCitigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified conditions. The Company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms.\\n\\nFinally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as conduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the normal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by Citigroup\\'s conduits. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company owned $10.1 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company’s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.\\n\\nThe asset-backed commercial paper conduits are consolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. These powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the\\n---\\n## conduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts of all the Company’s involvement described above, it was concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant. No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries.\\n\\nCollateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-investment grade corporate loans. CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the CLO. A third-party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the CLO’s asset management agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLO. Investors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of the CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on amendments to the CLO’s operating documents and other activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12 years.\\n\\nCiti serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the CLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s liabilities for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, typically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by the CLOs to support its market-making activities. The Company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLOs, as this power is generally held by a third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such, those CLOs are not consolidated.\\n\\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to Citigroup CLOs:\\n\\n|In billions of dollars|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows|$0.1|$0.3|$1.1|\\n|Purchases of previously transferred financial assets|-|-|$0.2|\\n\\n|Dec. 31|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars|Carrying value of retained interests|$604|$681|$921|\\n\\nAll of Citi’s retained interests were held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n---\\n## municipal bonds.\\n\\nIn cases where a third party provides liquidity to a non-customer TOB trust, a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed, whereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider.\\n\\n## Client Intermediation\\n\\nClient intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security, referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction. The Company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain transactions, the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $0.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which $0.3 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed.\\n\\nCiti considers both customer and non-customer TOB trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated by the Company, as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.\\n\\nNon-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated because the Company holds the Residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.\\n\\nThe Company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.\\n\\n## Investment Funds\\n\\nThe Company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, fixed income, and infrastructure. Citigroup earns a management fee, which is a percentage of capital under management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in the investment funds. Citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and non-recourse bases for a portion of the employees’ investment commitments.\\n\\nMunicipal Investments\\n\\nMunicipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership. The Company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are generally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner. Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup.\\n---\\n## Asset-Based Financing\\n\\nThe Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the Company. Financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings. The Company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ economic performance; thus, it does not consolidate them.\\n\\nThe primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023| |December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Total unconsolidated VIE assets|Maximum exposure to unconsolidated VIEs|Total unconsolidated VIE assets|Maximum exposure to unconsolidated VIEs|\\n|Type| | | | |\\n|Commercial and other real estate|$42,869|$8,831|$43,236|$8,806|\\n|Corporate loans|$27,903|$18,546|$23,120|$15,077|\\n|Other (including investment funds, airlines and shipping)|$121,711|$35,367|$166,320|$27,986|\\n| |Total|$192,483|$62,744|$232,676|$51,869|\\n---\\n## DERIVATIVES\\n\\nDerivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions, which include:\\n\\n- Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily convertible to cash.\\n- Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates based on differentials between specified indices or financial instruments, as applied to a notional principal amount.\\n- Option contracts, which give the purchaser the right, for a premium, to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices.\\n\\nSwaps, forwards, and some option contracts are over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties. Futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a central counterparty from the inception of the transaction.\\n\\nCitigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity, and other market/credit risks for various reasons:\\n\\n- Trading Purposes: Citigroup trades derivatives as an active market maker, offers derivatives to customers for risk management actions, and manages derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities.\\n- Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives for its risk management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the Company. Derivatives are also used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities.\\n\\nHedging may be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For example, Citigroup may issue fixed-rate long-term debt and then enter into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments to a net variable-rate basis.\\n\\nDerivatives are also used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities, commodities, borrowings, and other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt, foreign currency-denominated AFS securities, and net investment exposures.\\n\\nDerivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements, which provide for netting and collateral rights in the event of default by a counterparty.\\n\\nThe netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing.\\n\\nA legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights.\\n\\nIn some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty, which may impact the enforceability of netting and collateral rights.\\n---\\n## Exposure to Credit Risk on Derivatives\\n\\nExposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility, which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where Citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements.\\n\\n## Derivatives Activities Information\\n\\nInformation pertaining to Citigroup’s derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk), and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk.\\n\\n## Cash and Security Collateral\\n\\nCash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party; the receiving party is free to commingle/rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account at a third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account control agreement.\\n\\nIn addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity, and other factors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n---\\n## Derivative Notionals\\n\\n| |Hedging instruments under ASC 815| |Trading derivative instruments|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|In millions of dollars| | | | |\\n|Interest rate contracts| | | | |\\n|Swaps|$277,003|$255,280|$17,077,712|$23,780,711|\\n|Futures and forwards|-|-|$3,022,127|$2,966,025|\\n|Written options|-|-|$2,753,912|$1,937,025|\\n|Purchased options|-|-|$2,687,662|$1,881,291|\\n|Total interest rate contracts|$277,003|$255,280|$25,541,413|$30,565,052|\\n|Foreign exchange contracts| | | | |\\n|Swaps|$45,851|$48,678|$7,943,054|$6,746,070|\\n|Futures, forwards and spot|$49,779|$43,666|$3,737,063|$3,350,341|\\n|Written options|-|-|$778,397|$789,077|\\n|Purchased options|-|-|$771,134|$783,591|\\n|Total foreign exchange contracts|$95,630|$92,344|$13,229,648|$11,669,079|\\n|Equity contracts| | | | |\\n|Swaps|-|-|$317,117|$266,115|\\n|Futures and forwards|-|-|$72,592|$76,935|\\n|Written options|-|-|$544,315|$482,266|\\n|Purchased options|-|-|$428,949|$387,766|\\n|Total equity contracts|-|-|$1,362,973|$1,213,082|\\n|Commodity and other contracts| | | | |\\n|Swaps|-|-|$82,009|$90,884|\\n|Futures and forwards|1,750|1,571|161,811|165,314|\\n|Written options|-|-|49,555|45,862|\\n|Purchased options|-|-|46,742|48,197|\\n|Total commodity and other contracts|1,750|1,571|340,117|350,257|\\n|Credit derivatives (1)| | | | |\\n|Protection sold|-|-|$496,699|$593,136|\\n|Protection purchased|-|-|$567,627|$641,639|\\n|Total credit derivatives|-|-|$1,064,326|$1,234,775|\\n|Total derivative notionals|$374,383|$349,195|$41,538,477|$45,032,245|\\n\\n(1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk.\\n\\nThe following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.\\n---\\n## Derivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables\\n\\n|Derivatives classified in Trading account assets/liabilities|Assets|Liabilities|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Derivatives instruments designated as ASC 815 hedges| | |\\n|Over-the-counter|$458|$5|\\n|Cleared|$99|$121|\\n|Interest rate contracts|$557|$126|\\n|Foreign exchange contracts|$1690|$1732|\\n|Total derivatives instruments designated as ASC 815 hedges|$2247|$1858|\\n|Derivatives instruments not designated as ASC 815 hedges| | |\\n|Over-the-counter|$113993|$105512|\\n|Cleared|$43858|$47462|\\n|Exchange traded|$86|$86|\\n|Interest rate contracts|$157937|$153060|\\n|Foreign exchange contracts|$158004|$155469|\\n|Equity contracts|$43278|$47946|\\n|Commodity and other contracts|$17569|$18796|\\n|Credit derivatives|$8339|$8082|\\n|Total derivatives instruments not designated as ASC 815 hedges|$385127|$383353|\\n|Total derivatives|$387374|$385211|\\n|Less: Netting agreements|($308431)|($308431)|\\n|Less: Netting cash collateral received/paid|($21226)|($26101)|\\n|Net receivables/payables included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet|$57717|$50679|\\n|Additional amounts subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, but not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet| | |\\n|Less: Cash collateral received/paid|($563)|($348)|\\n|Less: Non-cash collateral received/paid|($5208)|($12504)|\\n|Total net receivables/payables|$51946|$37827|\\n\\n(1) The derivatives fair values are also presented in Note 26.\\n\\n(2) Definitions:\\n\\n- Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are derivatives executed and settled bilaterally with counterparties without the use of an organized exchange or central clearing house.\\n\\n- Cleared derivatives include derivatives executed bilaterally with a counterparty in the OTC market, but then novated to a central clearing house, whereby the central clearing house becomes the counterparty to both of the original counterparties.\\n\\n- Exchange-traded derivatives include derivatives executed directly on an organized exchange that provides pre-trade price transparency.\\n\\n(3) Represents the netting of balances with the same counterparty under enforceable netting agreements.

Citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 for further information.\\n\\nThe amounts recognized in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are presented below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains (losses) on the economically hedged items:\\n\\n| |Gains (losses) included in Other revenue|\\n|---|---|\\n|Year ended|2023|2022|2021|\\n|Interest rate contracts|$(47)|$141|$(70)|\\n|Foreign exchange|$(216)|$(56)|$(102)|\\n|Total|$(263)|$85|$(172)|\\n\\nAccounting for Derivative Hedging\\n\\nCitigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. As a general rule, hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings.\\n\\nDerivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries (i.e., net investment in a foreign operation) are net investment hedges.\\n\\nTo qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. The hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge. This includes the item and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed.\\n\\nHedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nCitigroup’s fair value hedges, which include hedges of closed pools of assets, are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt securities or loans.\\n\\nFor qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest income or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability.\\n---\\n## Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk\\n\\nCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt. The hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or a cross-currency swap contract. Changes in the fair value of the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) of forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in the fair value of cross-currency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in Other comprehensive income.\\n\\n## Hedging of Commodity Price Risk\\n\\nCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventories. The hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity. In this hedge, the change in the carrying value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings. Although the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings, under certain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes changes in the fair value of the forward points (i.e., spot-forward difference) of the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and they are generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Under other hedge programs, Citi excludes changes in the fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in Other comprehensive income.\\n\\n## Gains (losses) on fair value hedges\\n\\n| |2023|Net|2022|Net|2021|Net|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars| |Other revenue|Interest income|Other revenue|Interest income|Other revenue|Interest income|\\n|Gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives included in assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges| | | | | | |\\n|Interest rate hedges|$—|$(804)|$—|$(8,322)|$—|$(5,425)|\\n|Foreign exchange hedges|$1,433| |$(1,375)| |$(627)| |\\n|Commodity hedges|$(46)| |$(1,870)| |$(3,983)| |\\n|Total gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives included in assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges|$1,387|$(804)|$(3,245)|$(8,322)|$(4,610)|$(5,425)|\\n|Gain (loss) on the hedged item in designated and qualifying fair value hedges| | | | | | |\\n|Interest rate hedges|$—|$795|$—|$8,087|$—|$5,043|\\n|Foreign exchange hedges|$(1,433)| |$1,372| |$628| |\\n|Commodity hedges|$46| |$1,870| |$3,973| |\\n|Total gain (loss) on the hedged item in designated and qualifying fair value hedges|$(1,387)|$795|$3,242|$8,087|$4,601|$5,043|\\n|Net gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives excluded from assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges| | | | | | |\\n|Interest rate hedges|$—|$—|$—|$—|$—|$(9)|\\n|Foreign exchange hedges|$2| |$171| |$79| |\\n|Commodity hedges|$312| |$94| |$5| |\\n|Total net gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives excluded from assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges|$314| |$265| |$84|$(9)|\\n\\n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are included in Interest income/Interest expense. The accrued interest income on fair value hedges is recorded in Net interest income and is excluded from this table. Amounts included both hedges of AFS securities and long-term debt on a net basis, which largely offset in the current period.\\n\\n(2) The gain (loss) amounts for commodity hedges are included in Principal transactions for periods beginning 2023.\\n\\n(3) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in AOCI, are not reflected in the table above. The amount of cross-currency basis included in AOCI was $(70) million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\n(4) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness reflected directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach or recorded in AOCI under the amortization approach. The year ended December 31, 2023 includes gain (loss) of approximately $284 million and $28 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes gain (loss) of approximately $86 million and $8 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively.\\n---\\n## Cumulative Basis Adjustment\\n\\nUpon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi’s hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at December 31, 2023 and 2022, along with the cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Balance sheet line item in which hedged item is recorded|Carrying amount of hedged asset/liability|Cumulative basis adjustment increasing (decreasing) the carrying amount|Active|De-designated|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|As of December 31, 2023|Debt securities AFS (5)|$111,886|($925)|($282)| |\\n|Corporate loans (3)|$4,968|93|($3)| | |\\n|Long-term debt|$141,449|($908)|($5,160)| | |\\n|As of December 31, 2022|Debt securities AFS (5)|$98,837|($2,976)|($333)| |\\n|Long-term debt|$144,549|($5,040)|($3,399)| | |\\n\\n(1) Excludes physical commodities inventories with a carrying value of approximately $8 billion as of December 31, 2023, which includes cumulative basis adjustments of approximately $1.2 billion for active hedges.\\n\\n(2) These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $248 million for active hedges and $(51) million for de-designated hedges as of December 31, 2023, related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer approach. The Company designated approximately $14 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of financial assets with a carrying value of $28 billion as of December 31, 2023) in a portfolio layer-hedging relationship.\\n\\n(3) All hedged corporate loans are designated in a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer approach. The Company designated approximately $3.6 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of financial assets with a carrying value of $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2023).\\n\\n(4) These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $(91) million for active hedges and $(309) million for de-designated hedges as of December 31, 2022, related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the last-of-layer approach. The Company designated approximately $3 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of $11 billion as of December 31, 2022) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.\\n\\n(5) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.\\n---\\n## Cash Flow Hedges\\n\\nCitigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate swaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nFor cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Amount of gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on derivatives|$ (434)|$ (3,640)|$ (847)|\\n|Interest rate contracts| | | |\\n|Foreign exchange contracts|13|34|(51)|\\n|Total gain (loss) recognized in AOCI|$ (421)|$ (3,606)|$ (898)|\\n|Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI to earnings|Other|Net interest|Other|Net interest|Other|Net interest|\\n|Interest rate contracts|$ —|$ (1,897)|$ —|$ (125)|$ —|$ 1,075|\\n|Foreign exchange contracts|(4)| |(4)| |(4)| |\\n|Total gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings|$ (4)|$ (1,897)|$ (4)|$ (125)|$ (4)|$ 1,075|\\n|Net pretax change in cash flow hedges included within AOCI|$ 1,480|$ (3,477)|$ (1,969)|\\n\\n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net interest income). For all other hedges, the amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue and Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n\\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of December 31, 2023 is approximately $(0.8) billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 15 years.\\n\\nThe after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is presented in Note 21.\\n---\\n#### Net Investment Hedges\\n\\nConsistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—Foreign Currency Transactions, ASC 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI.\\n\\nFor derivatives designated as net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, including changes related to the forward-rate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options, are recorded in CTA within AOCI.\\n\\nFor foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded in CTA is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup.\\n\\nThe pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI, related to net investment hedges, was $(1.4) billion, $370 million and $855 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $36 million pretax loss related to net investment hedges, respectively, which were reclassified from AOCI into earnings (recorded in Other revenue).\\n\\n#### Economic Hedges\\n\\nCitigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in value included in either Principal transactions or Other revenue.\\n\\nFor asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.\\n\\nFor other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value, but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt.\\n\\nCitigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change. To the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes\\n\\n#### Credit Derivatives\\n\\nCiti is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions.\\n\\nCiti monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 98% and 98%, respectively, of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains master netting agreements, collateral agreements or settles daily. A majority of Citi’s top 15 counterparties (by receivable balance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for additional collateral.\\n\\nThe range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-linked notes.\\n\\nA credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and, in a more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount.\\n---\\nA total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity, subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer.\\n\\nA credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level. The option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity.\\n\\nA credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference entity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the credit-linked note.\\n---\\n## The following tables summarize the key characteristics of Citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form:\\n\\n| |Fair values| |Protection| |Notionals|Protection|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars at December 31, 2023|Receivable|Payable|Purchased|Sold| | |\\n|By instrument|$7,686|$7,243|$539,522|$491,514| | |\\n|Total return swaps and other|653|839|28,105|5,185| | |\\n|Total by instrument|$8,339|$8,082|$567,627|$496,699| | |\\n|By rating of reference entity|Investment grade|$4,282|$4,138|$444,989|$393,115| |\\n|Non-investment grade|$4,057|$3,944|$122,638|$103,584| | |\\n|Total by rating of reference entity|$8,339|$8,082|$567,627|$496,699| | |\\n|By maturity|Within 1 year|$986|$1,713|$155,910|$128,874| |\\n|From 1 to 5 years|$5,816|$4,939|$366,156|$337,583| | |\\n|After 5 years|$1,537|$1,430|$45,561|$30,242| | |\\n|Total by maturity|$8,339|$8,082|$567,627|$496,699| | |\\n\\n(1) The fair value amount receivable is composed of $2,770 million under protection purchased and $5,569 million under protection sold.\\n\\n(2) The fair value amount payable is composed of $6,097 million under protection purchased and $1,985 million under protection sold.\\n\\n| |Fair values| |Protection| |Notionals|Protection|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars at December 31, 2022|Receivable|Payable|Purchased|Sold| | |\\n|By instrument|$6,867|$7,360|$623,981|$586,504| | |\\n|Total return swaps and other|1,522|417|17,658|6,632| | |\\n|Total by instrument|$8,389|$7,777|$641,639|$593,136| | |\\n|By rating of reference entity|Investment grade|$3,796|$2,970|$499,339|$462,873| |\\n|Non-investment grade|$4,593|$4,807|$142,300|$130,263| | |\\n|Total by rating of reference entity|$8,389|$7,777|$641,639|$593,136| | |\\n|By maturity|Within 1 year|$1,753|$1,801|$147,031|$148,721| |\\n|From 1 to 5 years|$4,577|$4,134|$443,113|$407,293| | |\\n|After 5 years|$2,059|$1,842|$51,495|$37,122| | |\\n|Total by maturity|$8,389|$7,777|$641,639|$593,136| | |\\n\\n(1) The fair value amount receivable is composed of $5,094 million under protection purchased and $3,295 million under protection sold.\\n\\n(2) The fair value amount payable is composed of $3,573 million under protection purchased and $4,204 million under protection sold.\\n\\nFair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For notional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity.\\n\\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be “Baa/BBB” and above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system.\\n\\nCitigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-investment-grade reference entity represent greater payment risk to the Company. The non-investment-grade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative.\\n---\\nThe maximum potential amount of future payments under Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a credit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes, determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible. The Company actively monitors open credit-risk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies, including purchased credit derivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.\\n\\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives\\n\\nCertain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.\\n\\nThe fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $15 billion and $18 billion, respectively. The Company posted $12 billion and $15 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nA downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of December 31, 2023, the Company could be required to post an additional $0.5 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $33 million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.5 billion.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $4.3 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of December 31, 2023 was $121 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $29 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $1.4 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $27 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $32 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.\\n\\nThe balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.\\n---\\n## CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\\n\\nConcentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure. Although Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry, product and geographic lines, material transactions are completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives and foreign exchange businesses.\\n\\nIn connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one geographic region, country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Company’s exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $517.2 billion and $431.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The German, Mexican, Japanese and United Kingdom governments and their agencies, which are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, were the next largest exposures. The Company’s exposure to Germany amounted to $39.8 billion and $48.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s exposure to Mexico amounted to $32.8 billion and $31.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s exposure to Japan amounted to $29.6 billion and $40.0 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s exposure to the United Kingdom amounted to $23.8 billion and $31.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The foreign government exposures are composed of investment securities, loans and trading assets.\\n\\nThe Company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to $17.6 billion and $20.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was composed of trading assets, investment securities, derivatives and lending activities.\\n---\\n## 26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\\n\\nDetermination of Fair Value\\n\\nFor assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures fair value using the procedures set out below, irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election, a non-recurring lower-of-cost-or-market (LOCOM) adjustment, or because they are required to be measured at fair value.\\n\\nWhen available, the Company uses quoted market prices from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a market price is available, the Company will apply practical expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case the items may be classified as Level 2.\\n\\nThe Company may also apply a price-based methodology that utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued. If relevant and observable prices are available, those valuations may be classified as Level 2. However, when there are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs, those valuations will be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when a quoted price is considered stale, a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security being valued, or alternatively, when prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate a valuation, the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as Level 3.\\n\\n## Fair Value Hierarchy\\n\\nASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable\\n---\\ncertain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those own credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS criteria, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each credit rating and tenor. For certain identified netting sets where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures to counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-specific CDS spreads are used. For FVA, a term structure of spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures (e.g., the market liquidity spread used to represent the term funding premium associated with certain OTC derivatives).\\n\\nValuation adjustments are applied to items classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be exited. These valuation adjustments are based on the bid/offer spread for an instrument in the market. When Citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk position, the valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position.\\n\\nCredit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) are applied to certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk, own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value. This principally includes derivatives with a base valuation (e.g., discounted using overnight indexed swap (OIS)) requiring adjustment for these effects, such as uncollateralized interest rate swaps. The CVA represents a portfolio-level adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterparty’s (assets) or Citi’s (liabilities) non-performance risk.\\n\\nThe FVA represents a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that do not include standard credit support annexes (CSAs), such as where the CSA does not permit the reuse of collateral received. Citi’s FVA methodology leverages the existing CVA methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile. The calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements in which the terms do not permit the Company to reuse the collateral received, including where counterparties post collateral to third-party custodians. Citi’s CVA and FVA methodologies consist of two steps:\\n\\n- First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time. The calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants and sources of funding, including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this purpose, since it is those net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk. This process identifies specific, point-in-time future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance and term funding risk, rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the CVA and FVA.\\n- Second, for CVA, market-based views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap (CDS) market are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one.

Cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded derivatives or other features. These cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral. Generally, when such instruments are recorded at fair value, they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable. However, certain long-dated positions are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities and Trading Loans\\n\\nWhen available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities; such items are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include government securities and exchange-traded equity securities.\\n\\nFor bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, price-based and internal models. Fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, including third-party vendors. A price-based methodology utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of instruments with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. The yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information. Trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when the primary inputs to the valuation are unobservable, or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is generally classified as Level 3.\\n\\nInvestments\\n\\nThe investments category includes available-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor pricing as the primary source.\\n\\nAlso included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such securities are not generally traded. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The Company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, including guideline public company analysis and comparable transactions. In determining the fair value of nonpublic securities, the Company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances or other observable transactions. Private\\n---\\nEquity securities are generally classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\\nWhere fair value accounting has been elected, pe fair value of non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using pe appropriate discount rate for pe applicable maturity. Such instruments are classified wipin Level 2 of pe fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable.\\nThe Company determines pe fair value of hybrid financial instruments, including structured liabilities, using pe appropriate derivative valuation mepodology (described above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives”) given pe nature of pe embedded risk profile. Such instruments are classified wipin Level 2 or Level 3 depending on pe observability of significant inputs to pe valuation.\\n---\\n## Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\n\\nThe following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company may hedge positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2.

This leads to uncertainty around the final Unobservable Inputs Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today’s market. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value instruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s (or portfolio’s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another. In addition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the Company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For certain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs.\\n\\nThe following section describes some of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value measurements.\\n\\n## Correlation\\n\\nCorrelation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other. A variety of correlation-related assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other instruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations are not directly observable in the market and must be calculated using alternative sources, including historical information. Estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time, and calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market (e.g., swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value measurements is required.\\n\\nChanges in correlation levels can have a substantial impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of an instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche. For example, an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche. That same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure.\\n\\n## Volatility\\n\\nVolatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods, such as comparable instruments, historical analysis or other sources of\\n---\\n## Credit Spread\\n\\nThe fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible Credit spread is a component of the security representing its using quoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, the fair values depend on the type of collateral. Fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation techniques.\\n\\nWhere the fair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised value, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. In addition, for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral, these fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3.\\n\\nThe fair value of non-marketable equity securities under the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer, or an internal valuation technique in the case of an impairment. Where there are insufficient market observations to conclude the inputs are observable, where significant adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation technique is used, the security is classified as Level 3. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.\\n\\n## Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\\n\\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.\\n\\n**December 31, 2023**\\n|In millions of dollars|Fair value|Level 2|Level 3|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Loans HFS (1)|$1,171|$495|$676|\\n|Other real estate owned|$4|—|$4|\\n|Loans (2)|$328|—|$328|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative|$359|—|$359|\\n|Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis|$1,862|$495|$1,367|\\n\\n**December 31, 2022**\\n|In millions of dollars|Fair value|Level 2|Level 3|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Loans HFS (1)|$2,336|$457|$1,879|\\n|Other real estate owned|$1|—|$1|\\n|Loans (2)|$69|—|$69|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative|$597|—|$597|\\n|Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis|$3,003|$457|$2,546|\\n\\n(1) Net of mark-to-market amounts on the unfunded portion of loans HFS recognized as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\n(2) Represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate.\\n---\\n## Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\\n\\n|Fair value (1)| | |Weighted (3)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|As of December 31, 2023|(in millions)|Methodology|Input|Low|High|average|\\n|Loans HFS|$674|Price-based|Price|$67.50|$100.00|$93.39|\\n|Loans|$296|Recovery analysis|Appraised value (4)|$12,000|$75,997,078|$46,121,923|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative|$250|Price-based|Price|$1.57|$2,637.00|$1,114.06|\\n| |109|Comparable analysis|Revenue multiple|2.3x|35.7x|11.69x|\\n|Other real estate owned|$3|Price-based|Appraised value (4)|$401,042|$2,061,700|$155,696|\\n\\n|Fair value (1)| | |Weighted (3)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|As of December 31, 2022|(in millions)|Methodology|Input|Low|High|average|\\n|Loans HFS|$1,830|Price-based|Price|$0.88|$100.23|$65.91|\\n|Other real estate owned|$1|Price-based|Appraised value (4)|$30,000|$441,750|$310,552|\\n|Loans|$45|Recovery analysis|Appraised value (4)|$12,000|$14,022,820|$3,714,342|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative|$363|Price-based|Price|$0.46|$2,416.43|$557.86|\\n| |234|Comparable analysis|Revenue multiple|4.95x|73.10x|19.68x|\\n\\n(1) The tables above include the fair values for the items listed and may not foot to the total population for each category.\\n\\n(2) Some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding.\\n\\n(3) Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments.\\n\\n(4) Appraised values are disclosed in whole dollars.\\n\\n(5) Represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate.\\n\\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value Changes\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|Year ended December 31,|2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Loans HFS|$ (119)|$ (58)| |\\n|Other real estate owned| |—|—|\\n|Loans|$ (148)|$ 13| |\\n|Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative|$ (72)|$ 315| |\\n|Total nonrecurring fair value gains (losses)|$ (339)|$ 270| |\\n\\n(1) Represents loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate.\\n---\\n## Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\\n\\nThe following tables present the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value.

The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.\\n---\\n## FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS\\n\\nThe Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability, or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI.\\n\\nThe Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 23 for additional details on Citi’s MSRs. Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 26.\\n\\n**Changes in fair value—gains (losses) for the years ended December 31**\\n|In millions of dollars|2023|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Assets| | |\\n|Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell|$267|($109)|\\n|Trading account assets|97|(296)|\\n|Loans| | |\\n|Certain corporate loans|2,038|(1,763)|\\n|Certain consumer loans|6|(1)|\\n|Total loans|$2,044|(1,764)|\\n|Other assets| | |\\n|MSRs|$28|201|\\n|Certain mortgage loans HFS (1)|(23)|(455)|\\n|Total other assets|$5|(254)|\\n|Total assets|$2,413|(2,423)|\\n|Liabilities| | |\\n|Interest-bearing deposits|($97)|42|\\n|Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase|(217)|110|\\n|Trading account liabilities|138|(239)|\\n|Short-term borrowings (2)|(18)|1,424|\\n|Long-term debt (2)|(12,998)|15,589|\\n|Total liabilities|($13,192)|16,926|\\n\\n(1) Includes gains (losses) associated with interest rate lock commitments for originated loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option.\\n\\n(2) Includes DVA that is included in AOCI. See Notes 21 and 26.\\n---\\n## Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)\\n\\nOwn debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI. See Note 21 for additional information.\\n\\nAmong other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads.\\n\\nThe estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss of $2,078 million and gain of $2,685 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.\\n\\n## The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\\n\\nSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings\\n\\nThe Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.\\n\\nChanges in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n\\n## Certain Loans and Other Credit Products\\n\\nCitigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.\\n\\n## Table: Information about Certain Credit Products Carried at Fair Value\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|In millions of dollars| |Trading assets|Loans|Trading assets|Loans|\\n|Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet|$4,518|$7,594|$6,011|$5,360|\\n|Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value| |88|10|167|51|\\n|Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due| |1| |2|\\n|Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due| |1| |1|\\n\\nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $391 million and $729 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n---\\n## Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\\n\\nAs part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.\\n\\nRelated interest income is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a gain of $39 million and loss of $155 million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.\\n\\n## Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals\\n\\nCitigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum, and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.6 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\n## Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\\n\\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.\\n\\n|In millions of dollars|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet|$571|$793|\\n|Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance|17|(10)|\\n|Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due|3|1|\\n|Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due|-|-|\\n\\nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment, and recovery forecasts in addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n---\\n## Certain Debt Liabilities\\n\\nThe Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt or Short-term borrowings on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\n**Carrying value of notes carried at fair value**\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Interest rate linked|$60.4|$53.4|\\n|Foreign exchange linked|-|$0.1|\\n|Equity linked|$45.9|$42.5|\\n|Commodity linked|$5.3|$5.0|\\n|Credit linked|$4.7|$5.0|\\n|Total|$116.3|$106.0|\\n\\nThe portion of the changes in fair value attributable to financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected through earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (i.e., DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions.\\n\\n## Certain Non-Structured Liabilities\\n\\nThe Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates. The Company has elected the fair value option where the interest rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase.\\n\\n**Long-term debt carried at fair value**\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet|$116,338|$105,995|\\n|Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value|($2,842)|($2,944)|\\n\\n**Short-term borrowings carried at fair value**\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet|$6,545|$6,222|\\n|Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value|($60)|($9)|\\n---\\n## PLEDGED ASSETS, RESTRICTED CASH, COLLATERAL, GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS\\n\\nPledged Assets\\n\\nIn connection with Citi’s financing and trading activities, Citi has pledged assets to collateralize its obligations under repurchase agreements, secured financing agreements, secured liabilities of consolidated VIEs and other borrowings. The approximate carrying values of the significant components of pledged assets recognized on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included the following:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Investment securities|$229.2|$246.3|\\n|Loans|$292.3|$261.4|\\n|Trading account assets|$199.3|$136.0|\\n|Total|$720.8|$643.7|\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, $511.6 billion and $502.0 billion, respectively, of these pledged assets may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties.\\n\\nRestricted Cash\\n\\nCitigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers’ primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority.\\n\\nRestricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Cash and due from banks|$3,479|$4,820|\\n|Deposits with banks, net of allowance|$15,538|$12,156|\\n|Total|$19,017|$16,976|\\n\\nIn addition to the restricted cash amounts presented above, at December 31, 2023 approximately $3.9 billion was held at the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) and was subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. At December 31, 2022, $1.8 billion was held at the National Settlements Depository (NSD) and was also subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. In April 2023, the balances held in the NSD were transferred to the DIA. For the rest of 2023, all balances that previously would have been transferred to the NSD were transferred to the DIA. These restricted amounts are reported within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n---\\n## Guarantees\\n\\nCiti provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide range of business transactions. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.\\n\\n### Maximum potential amount of future payments\\n\\n| |Expire within 1 year|Expire after 1 year|Total amount outstanding|Carrying value (in millions of dollars)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Financial standby letters of credit|$17.8|$63.5|$81.3|674|\\n|Performance guarantees|4.8|5.8|10.6|49|\\n|Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees|24.2|16.3|40.5|362|\\n|Loans sold with recourse|0.6|1.2|1.8|16|\\n|Securities lending indemnifications (1)|104.1|-|104.1|-|\\n|Credit card merchant processing (2)|138.0|-|138.0|-|\\n|Credit card arrangements with partners|0.2|0.2|0.4|5|\\n|Other (3)|27.7|7.7|35.4|50|\\n|Total|$317.4|$94.7|$412.1|$1,156|\\n\\n### Maximum potential amount of future payments\\n\\n| |Expire within 1 year|Expire after 1 year|Total amount outstanding|Carrying value (in millions of dollars)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Financial standby letters of credit|$31.3|$58.3|$89.6|905|\\n|Performance guarantees|6.1|5.6|11.7|65|\\n|Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees|18.5|30.0|48.5|353|\\n|Loans sold with recourse|-|1.7|1.7|13|\\n|Securities lending indemnifications (1)|95.9|-|95.9|-|\\n|Credit card merchant processing (2)|129.6|-|129.6|1|\\n|Credit card arrangements with partners|-|0.6|0.6|7|\\n|Other|0.1|8.4|8.5|32|\\n|Total|$281.5|$104.6|$386.1|$1,376|\\n\\n(1) The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications were not material for either period presented, as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees is minimal.\\n\\n(2) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be approximately $138 billion and $130 billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\\n\\n(3) Includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program.\\n---\\n## Financial Standby Letters of Credit\\n\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and these amounts Citi issues standby letters of credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is obligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial standby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-counter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below), (iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade acceptances.\\n\\n## Securities Lending Indemnifications\\n\\nOwners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation. Banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients. Securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security.\\n\\n## Performance Guarantees\\n\\nPerformance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systems-installation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms. They are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products, commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party.\\n\\n## Credit Card Merchant Processing\\n\\nCredit card merchant processing guarantees represent the Company’s indirect obligations in connection with (i) providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its private label cards and (ii) potential liability for bank card transaction processing services. The nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor. The merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In general, if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder.\\n\\n## Derivative Instruments Considered to Be Guarantees\\n\\nDerivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index, where there is little or no initial investment and whose terms require or permit net settlement. See Note 24 for a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities. Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party.\\n\\n## Loans Sold with Recourse\\n\\nLoans sold with recourse represent Citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any loans that become delinquent.\\n\\nIn addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase reserve was approximately $11 million and $10 million at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nHowever, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $138.0 billion and $129.6 billion, respectively.\\n---\\nto merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to contingent liability related to merchant processing based on indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. As the financial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of Citi’s contingent Value-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing obligations related to merchant processing activities were Houses) (VTNs) immaterial. Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value- transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations. Citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN’s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi’s participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables above, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 or 2022 for potential obligations that could arise from Citi’s involvement with VTN associations.\\n\\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement. To the extent that such origination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations.\\n\\nOther Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products, and protection for certain travel-related purchases. These guarantees are not included in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\\n\\nLong-Term Care Insurance Indemnification In 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this transaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two collateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As part of GE’s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth through GE’s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth.\\n\\nIn connection with Citi’s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder claims) relating to\\n\\nOther Representation and Warranty Indemnifications In the normal course of business, Citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications, including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed, due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide Citi with comparable indemnifications. While such representations, warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to Citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception. No compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties, and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses, and\\n---\\nthe LTC business for the entire term of the Travelers LTC brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over time.\\n\\nIf both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original Travelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason, including its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform under its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the capital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two Genworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi, through its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse Brighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC policies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi would become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable, there is no liability reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to this indemnification. However, if both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but less than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\\n\\nFutures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing\\n\\nCiti provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 24 for a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nAs a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers.\\n\\nThere are two types of margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from customers). However, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances, the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi’s bankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately $17.8 billion and $18.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nVariation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client’s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform.\\n\\nAs required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nFICC Sponsored Member Repo Program\\n\\nCiti acts as a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) to clear eligible resale and repurchase agreements on behalf of its clients that become sponsored members of the FICC. Citi, as sponsoring member, is required to provide a guarantee to the FICC with respect to the prompt payment and performance of its sponsored members. Because Citi obtains a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house, Citi expects the risk of loss from this guarantee to be remote. See Note 12 for additional information on Citi’s resale and repurchase agreements, including risk mitigation practices for these transactions.\\n\\nCarrying Value—Guarantees and Indemnifications\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities.\\n---\\n## Collateral\\n\\nRatings are considered to be Baa/BBB and above, while Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $52.5 billion and $51.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $67.7 billion and $63.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.\\n\\n## Performance Risk\\n\\nCiti evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings.

Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.\\n\\nCredit Card Lines\\n\\nCitigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit cards. The credit card lines are cancelable by providing notice to the cardholder or without such notice as permitted by local law.\\n\\nCommercial and Other Consumer Loan Commitments\\n\\nCommercial and other consumer loan commitments include overdraft and liquidity facilities as well as commercial commitments to make or purchase loans, purchase third-party receivables, provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities and invest in the form of equity.\\n\\nOther Commitments\\n\\nAs a Federal Reserve member bank, Citi is required to subscribe to half of a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve District Bank. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Citi holds shares with a carrying value of $4.5 billion, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve District Bank Board.\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Citigroup had approximately $120.9 billion and $111.6 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $96.4 billion and $37.3 billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. See Note 12 for a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company’s policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. These amounts are not included in the table above.\\n\\nOne- to Four-Family Residential Mortgages\\n\\nA one- to four-family residential mortgage commitment is a written confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a property that the bank will advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to complete the purchase.\\n\\nRevolving Open-End Loans Secured by One- to Four-Family Residential Properties\\n\\nRevolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties are essentially home equity lines of credit. A home equity line of credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or second home to the extent of the excess of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the first mortgage.\\n\\nCommercial Real Estate, Construction and Land Development\\n\\nCommercial real estate, construction and land development include unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land development projects.\\n---\\n## LEASES\\n\\nCiti’s future lease payments are as follows:\\n\\nThe Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n\\nFor additional information regarding Citi’s leases, see Note 1.\\n\\nThe following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and equipment and Other liabilities, respectively:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|ROU asset|$2,801|$2,892|\\n|Lease liability|$2,974|$3,076|\\n\\nThe Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\\n\\nThe following table presents the total operating lease expense (principally for offices, branches and equipment) included in the Consolidated Statement of Income:\\n\\n| |Dec. 31, 2023|Dec. 31, 2022|Dec. 31, 2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Operating lease expense|$842|$852|$872|\\n|Variable lease expense|$208|$199|$201|\\n|Total lease costs (1)|$1,050|$1,051|$1,073|\\n\\n(1) Balances do not include $3 million, $3 million and $12 million of sublease income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n\\nThe table below provides the supplemental Statement of Cash Flows information:\\n\\n| |December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities|$714|$725|\\n|ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities(1)|$456|$775|\\n\\n(1) Represents non-cash activity and, accordingly, is not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\\n---\\n## CONTINGENCIES\\n\\nLitigation, Regulatory, and Other Contingencies\\n\\nOverview. In addition to the matters described below, in the Accounting and Disclosure Framework ASC 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies, including potential losses from litigation, regulatory, tax, and other matters. ASC 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.” It imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events. It distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms: “probable,” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur”; “remote,” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight”; and “reasonably possible,” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely.” These three terms are used below as defined in ASC 450.\\n\\nAccruals. ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.” In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued, unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters.\\n\\nDisclosure. ASC 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, if Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because Citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable, and the reasonably possible loss is material, it discloses the loss contingency. In addition, Citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made. ASC 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote.\\n\\nLitigation, Regulatory, and Other Contingencies\\n\\nOverview. In addition to the matters described below, in the ordinary course of business, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and current and former officers, directors, and employees (for purposes of this section, sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties) routinely are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings. Certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection, fair lending, securities, banking, antifraud, antitrust, anti-money laundering, employment, and other statutory and common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief, and in some instances seek recovery on a class-wide basis.\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and Related Parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or other relief. In addition, certain affiliates and subsidiaries of Citigroup are banks, registered broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, investment advisors or other regulated entities and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation by various U.S., state, and foreign securities, banking, commodity futures, consumer protection, and other regulators. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, Citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas, and orders seeking documents, testimony, and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities. From time to time Citigroup and Related Parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance, formal or informal, from federal or state law enforcement agencies including, among others, various United States Attorneys’ Offices, the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and other divisions of the Department of Justice, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating to Citigroup and its customers.\\n\\nBecause of the global scope of Citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world, Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) in multiple jurisdictions with legal, regulatory, and tax regimes that may differ substantially, and present substantially different risks, from those Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to in the United States. In some instances, Citigroup and Related Parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions, which may result in overlapping, cumulative or inconsistent outcomes.\\n\\nCitigroup seeks to resolve all litigation, regulatory, tax, and other matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of Citigroup and its shareholders, and contests liability, allegations of wrongdoing, and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter.\\n---\\n### Inherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed\\n\\nCertain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters typically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities, and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other remedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case, proceeding or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among other things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties, rulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts, and engagement in settlement negotiations.\\n\\nDepending on a range of factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of the legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court’s scheduling order, the timing of court decisions, and the adverse party’s, regulator’s or other authority’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding or an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made.\\n\\n### Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made\\n\\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, Citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For some of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable, but a reasonably possible exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount. For other matters included within this estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss, although estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable; in these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31, 2023, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate.\\n\\nThese estimates are based on currently available information. As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, and tax proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties.\\n\\n### FDIC Special Assessment\\n\\nOn November 29, 2023, the FDIC published a final rule implementing a special assessment—primarily on large banks—to recover the uninsured deposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC estimated the total cost of the failures to be approximately $16.3 billion, which is attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors, an estimate that will be periodically adjusted when warranted. The FDIC will collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.44 basis points of December 31, 2022 estimated uninsured deposits exceeding $5 billion, over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi accrued an estimated liability of $1.7 billion within Other liabilities and reported the corresponding expense in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the special assessment.\\n---\\n## Foreign Exchange Litigation\\n\\nIn 2019, two motions for certification of class actions were filed against Citigroup, Citibank, Citicorp, and other defendants:\\n\\n|In the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (later transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York)|NYPL v. JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., ET AL.|\\n|---|---|\\n|In the Tel Aviv Central District Court in Israel|GERTLER, ET AL. v. DEUTSCHE BANK AG|\\n\\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants manipulated the foreign exchange markets. Citibank\\'s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\\' petition for certification was denied in August 2021. The Supreme Court of Israel denied Citibank\\'s motion for leave to appeal the Central District Court\\'s denial of its motion to dismiss in April 2022. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number CA 29013-09-18.\\n\\n### Fund Administration Matter\\n\\nIn 2016, an arbitration proceeding was commenced in Brazil\\'s Market Arbitration Chamber against an asset manager of a Brazilian real estate investment fund and Citibank Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mob S.A. (Citi DTVM). The arbitration panel concluded in 2020 that the asset manager had engaged in fraudulent activities in certain real estate projects and that Citi DTVM was jointly and severally liable pursuant to the terms of the fund administration contract. The damages phase of the arbitration proceeding is ongoing.\\n\\n## Interbank Offered Rates-Related Litigation and Other Matters\\n\\nIn August 2020, individual borrowers and consumers of loans and credit cards filed an action against Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California:\\n\\nJ WISBEY & ASSOCIATES PTY LTD v. UBS AG & ORS\\n\\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix ICE LIBOR, assert claims under the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, and seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and treble damages. In October 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On October 10, 2023, the court granted defendants\\' motion.\\n---\\nmotion to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice for out from the settlement. Several merchants and merchant groups have appealed the final approval order. On September 27, 2021, the court granted the injunctive relief class plaintiffs’ motion to certify a non-opt-out class. On March 15, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s final approval of the damages class settlement and remanded the case back to the trial court for administration of the settlement claims process. On January 8, 2024, the district court issued decisions on two pending motions for summary judgment. It granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motions for summary judgment. The district court also denied Mastercard’s motion for summary judgment as to Mastercard’s lack of market power. Other motions for summary judgment remain pending. Additional information concerning these consolidated actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket number MDL 05-1720 (E.D.N.Y.) (Brodie, J.).\\n\\n## Interchange Fee Litigation\\n\\nBeginning in 2005, several putative class actions were filed against Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp, together with Visa, MasterCard, and other banks and their affiliates, in various federal district courts and consolidated with other related individual cases in a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. This proceeding is captioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs, merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards, as well as various membership associations that claim to represent certain groups of merchants, allege, among other things, that defendants have engaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and merchant discount fees on credit and debit card transactions and to restrain trade unreasonably through various Visa and MasterCard rules governing merchant conduct, all in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and certain California statutes. Plaintiffs further allege violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Supplemental complaints also were filed against defendants in the putative class actions alleging that Visa’s and MasterCard’s respective initial public offerings were anticompetitive and violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and that MasterCard’s initial public offering constituted a fraudulent conveyance.\\n\\nIn 2014, the district court entered a final judgment approving the terms of a class settlement. Various objectors appealed from the final class settlement approval order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\\n\\nIn 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s approval of the class settlement and remanded for further proceedings. The district court thereafter appointed separate interim counsel for a putative class seeking damages and a putative class seeking injunctive relief. Amended or new complaints on behalf of the putative classes and various individual merchants were subsequently filed, including a further amended complaint on behalf of a putative damages class and a new complaint on behalf of a putative injunctive class, both of which named Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp LLC. In addition, numerous merchants have filed amended or new complaints against Visa, MasterCard, and in some instances one or more issuing banks, including Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp Payment Services.\\n\\nIn 2019, the district court granted the damages class plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of a new settlement with the defendants. The settlement involves the damages class only and does not settle the claims of the injunctive relief class or any actions brought on a non-class basis by individual merchants. The settlement provides for a cash payment to the damages class of $6.24 billion, later reduced by $700 million based on the transaction volume of class members that opted\\n\\n## Interest Rate and Credit Default Swap Litigation\\n\\nBeginning in 2015, Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML, and numerous other parties were named as defendants in a number of industry-wide putative class actions related to interest rate swap (IRS) trading. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption IN RE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The actions allege that defendants colluded to prevent the development of exchange-like trading for IRS and assert federal and state antitrust claims and claims for unjust enrichment. Also consolidated under the same caption are individual actions filed by swap execution facilities, asserting federal and state antitrust claims, as well as claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference with business relations. Plaintiffs in these actions seek treble damages, fees, costs, and injunctive relief. Lead plaintiffs in the class action moved for class certification in 2019 and subsequently filed an amended complaint. On December 15, 2023, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On December 28, 2023, plaintiffs filed a petition seeking interlocutory review of the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 18-CV-5361 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.) and 16-MD-2704 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.).\\n\\nIn 2017, Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML, and numerous other parties were named as defendants in an action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption TERA GROUP, INC., ET AL. v. CITIGROUP, INC., ET AL. The complaint alleges that defendants colluded to prevent the development of exchange-like trading for credit default swaps and asserts federal and state antitrust claims and state law tort claims. In January 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which defendants later moved to dismiss. On August 14, 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice for all claims against Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, and CGML. On January 10, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 17-CV-4302 (S.D.N.Y.) (Sullivan, J.).\\n---\\n## Madoff-Related Litigation\\n\\nIn 2008, a Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) trustee was appointed for the SIPA liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BLMIS) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Beginning in 2010, the SIPA trustee commenced actions against multiple Citi entities, including Citibank, Citicorp North America, Inc., and CGML, captioned PICARD v. CITIBANK, N.A., ET AL., seeking recovery of monies that originated at BLMIS and were allegedly received by the Citi entities as subsequent transferees.\\n\\nIn February 2022, the SIPA trustee filed an amended complaint against Citibank, Citicorp North America, Inc., and CGML. In April 2022, these Citi entities moved to dismiss the amended complaint, which the bankruptcy court denied. In November 2022, the remaining Citi entities moved to file an interlocutory appeal of the bankruptcy court’s decision and answered the amended complaint. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 10-5345 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (Morris, J.) and 22-9597 (S.D.N.Y.) (Gardephe, J.).\\n\\n## Parmalat Litigation\\n\\nIn 2004, an Italian commissioner appointed to oversee the administration of various Parmalat companies filed a complaint against Citigroup, Citibank, and related parties, alleging that the defendants facilitated a number of frauds by Parmalat insiders. In 2008, a jury rendered a verdict in Citigroup’s favor and awarded Citi $431 million. In 2019, the Italian Supreme Court affirmed the decision in the full amount of $431 million. Citigroup has taken steps to enforce the judgment in Italian and Belgian courts. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 4133/2019 and 22098/2019 (Italy), and 20/3617/A, 2021/AR/1658, and 2022/AR/945 (Brussels).\\n\\nIn 2015, Parmalat filed a claim in an Italian civil court in Milan claiming damages of €1.8 billion against Citigroup, Citibank, and related parties. The Milan court dismissed Parmalat’s claim on grounds that it was duplicative of Parmalat’s previously unsuccessful claims. In 2019, the Milan Court of Appeal rejected Parmalat’s appeal of the Milan court’s dismissal. In June 2019, Parmalat filed a further appeal with the Italian Supreme Court. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 20598/2019.\\n\\nOn January 29, 2020, Parmalat, its three directors, and its sole shareholder, Sofil S.a.s., as co-plaintiffs, filed a claim before the Italian civil court in Milan seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not owe compensatory damages of €990 million to Citibank. On November 5, 2020, Citibank joined the proceedings, seeking dismissal of the declaratory judgment application and raised a counterclaim, seeking €990 million as damages. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 8611/2020.\\n\\n## Shareholder Derivative and Securities Litigation\\n\\nBeginning in October 2020, four derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of Citigroup (as nominal defendant) against certain of Citigroup’s current and former directors. The actions were later consolidated under the case\\n---\\n## name IN RE CITIGROUP INC. SHAREHOLDER\\n\\nthe Southern District of New York against Citigroup and DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and contribution and indemnification in connection with defendants’ alleged failures to implement adequate internal controls. In addition, the consolidated complaint asserts derivative claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with statements in Citigroup’s 2019 and 2020 annual meeting proxy statements. In February 2021, the court stayed the action pending resolution of defendants’ motion to dismiss in IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION. In April 2023, after defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted in IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION, the court maintained the stay in this action pending resolution of the securities plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend the complaint and, if leave is granted, any subsequent motion to dismiss. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 1:20-CV-09438 (S.D.N.Y.)

Plaintiffs allege that defendants colluded to fix U.S. Treasury auction bids by sharing competitively sensitive information ahead of the auctions, and that defendants colluded to boycott and prevent the emergence of an anonymous, all-to-all electronic trading platform in the U.S. Treasuries secondary market. Plaintiffs assert claims under antitrust laws, and seek damages, including treble damages where authorized by statute, and injunctive relief. In March 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss, without prejudice. In May 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint. In June 2021, certain defendants, including CGMI, moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In March 2022, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice, and the plaintiffs appealed. On February 1, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 15-MD-2673 (S.D.N.Y.) (Gardephe, J.) and 22-943 (2d Cir.).\\n\\n##\\n\\nIn 2018, a putative class action was filed against Citigroup, CGMI, Citigroup Financial Products Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citibanamex, Grupo Banamex, and other banks, captioned IN RE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BONDS ANTITRUST LITIGATION, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that defendants colluded in the Mexican sovereign bond market. In September 2019, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss. In December 2019, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against Citibanamex and other market makers in the Mexican sovereign bond market. Plaintiffs no longer assert any claims against Citigroup or any other U.S. Citi affiliates. The amended complaint alleges a conspiracy to fix prices in the Mexican sovereign bond market, asserts antitrust and unjust enrichment claims, and seeks treble damages, restitution, and injunctive relief. In February 2020, certain defendants, including Citibanamex,\\n---\\nmoved to dismiss the amended complaint. In November 2020, consolidated amended complaint in part. In June 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss, and the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ partial motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. In October 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of persons and entities who, from February 2008 to November 2015, paid interest rates on VRDOs with respect to the antitrust claim. Plaintiffs also moved to certify a subclass of individuals who entered into remarketing agreements with the defendants during that same period. On September 21, 2023, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, certifying both an antitrust class and a breach-of-contract subclass. On October 5, 2023, defendants filed a Rule 23(f) petition seeking leave to appeal the certification ruling. On November 8, 2023, the court dismissed certain defendants from the case, including Citigroup, Citibank, and CGML. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral argument on defendants’ Rule 23(f) petition on January 23, 2024. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 18-CV-2830 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.) and 22-2039 (2d Cir.).\\n\\nIn February 2021, purchasers of Euro-denominated sovereign debt issued by European central governments added CGMI, CGML, and others as defendants to a putative class action, captioned IN RE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BONDS ANTITRUST LITIGATION, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to inflate prices of European government bonds in primary market auctions and to fix the prices of European government bonds in secondary markets. Plaintiffs assert a claim under the Sherman Act and seek treble damages and attorneys’ fees. In March 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint as to certain defendants, but denied defendants’ motion to dismiss as to other defendants, including CGMI and CGML. In November 2022, plaintiffs moved for leave to amend the complaint, which the court granted on September 25, 2023. On October 16, 2023, plaintiffs filed a fifth amended complaint. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 19-CV-2601 (S.D.N.Y.)

BANK OF AMERICA CORP, ET AL. and MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP., ET AL. filed a consolidated complaint naming as defendants Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML, and numerous other industry participants. The consolidated complaint asserts violations of the Sherman Act, as well as claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment, and seeks damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that defendants served as remarketing agents for municipal bonds called variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) and colluded to set artificially high VRDO interest rates. On November 6, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint.\\n\\nSettlement Payments\\n\\nPayments required in settlement agreements described above have been made or are covered by existing litigation or other accruals.\\n\\nOn June 2, 2021, the Board of Directors of the San Diego Association of Governments, acting as the San Diego County Regional Transportation Commission, filed a parallel putative class action against the same defendants named in the already pending nationwide consolidated class action.

Compliance with these rules could limit those operations of CGMI that require the intensive use of capital and also limits the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates.\\n\\nRecent Rules Regarding Swap Dealers/Security-Based Swap Dealers\\n\\nOn July 22, 2020, the CFTC adopted final rules establishing capital and financial reporting requirements for swap dealers that took effect in October 2021. In addition, the SEC has adopted rules governing the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. The regulations include requirements related to capital, margin and segregation, record-keeping, reporting and notification, and risk management practices for uncleared security-based swaps and the cross-border application of certain security-based swap requirements. These requirements took effect in November 2021. Citibank, CGML, and CGME registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers.\\n\\nTransactions with Affiliates\\n\\nTransactions between Citi’s U.S. subsidiary depository institutions and their non-bank affiliates are regulated by the FRB and are generally required to be on arm’s-length terms.\\n\\nCOMPETITION\\n\\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. Citi’s competitors include a variety of financial services and advisory companies, as well as certain non-financial services firms. Citi competes for clients and capital (including deposits and funding in the short- and long-term debt markets) with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis. Citi’s competitive position depends on many factors, including, among others, the value of Citi’s brand name and reputation, and the types of clients and geographies served; the quality, range, performance, innovation, and pricing of products and services; the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, maintenance of partner relationships, emerging technologies and technology advances, customer service and convenience; the effectiveness of transaction execution, interest rates, lending limits, and risk appetite; regulatory constraints and\\n---\\ncompliance; and changes in the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms. Citi’s ability to compete effectively also depends upon its ability to attract new colleagues and retain and motivate existing colleagues, while managing compensation and other costs. For additional information on competitive factors and uncertainties impacting Citi’s businesses, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.\\n\\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT\\n\\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law.

Citi grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method for calculating EPS, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.\\n\\n## Partner payments\\n\\nPayments made to credit card partners primarily based on program sales, profitability and customer acquisitions.\\n\\n## PD\\n\\nProbability of default\\n\\n## Principal transactions revenue\\n\\nPrimarily trading-related revenues predominantly generated by the Services, Markets and Banking businesses.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced Approaches are that for Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings, which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized Approach and Basel III Advanced Approaches.\\n\\n## S&P: Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings\\n\\n## SCB: Stress Capital Buffer\\n\\n## SCF: Subscription credit facility\\n\\nSCFs are revolving credit facilities provided to private equity funds that are secured against the fund’s investors’ capital commitments.\\n\\n## SEC: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\n\\n## Securities financing agreements\\n\\nInclude resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements.\\n\\n## SLR: Supplementary Leverage ratio\\n\\nRepresents Tier 1 Capital divided by Total Leverage Exposure.\\n\\n## SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate\\n\\n## SPEs: Special purpose entities\\n\\n## Standardized Approach\\n\\nEstablished through Basel III, the Standardized Approach aligns regulatory capital requirements more closely with the key elements of banking risk by introducing a wider differentiation of risk weights and a wider recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques, while avoiding excessive complexity. Accordingly, the Standardized Approach produces capital ratios more in line with the actual economic risks that banks are facing.\\n\\n## Structured notes\\n\\nFinancial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates or other market variables.
